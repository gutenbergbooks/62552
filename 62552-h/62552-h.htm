  <h2 class='c005'><i>Introduction</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Terrain Exercises are those military exercises in
which the students carry on the operations of imaginary
bodies of troops over the actual terrain. As
these exercises involve the study of the utilization of
the ground itself and the application of tactical formations
and methods to it, they are the best means,
aside from practical field work with troops, of giving
officers and non-commissioned officers practice in
carrying out the duties that fall to them in war.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Terrain Exercise is found the logical step
in tactical training, between the theory and practice
of the classroom and the practical training with
troops. This method of training is suited to all arms
and services, and in view of its practical value is
constantly employed by unit commanders in the
training of their officers and non-commissioned
officers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Any class of military operations may be practiced,
such as the operations of covering troops—advance
guards, flank guards and outposts; the operations of
the various kinds of patrols; combat—attack and
defense; approach march and deployment, and the
tactical cooperation of all special arms.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Director</h3>

<p class='c012'>The smooth working and success of the Terrain
Exercise depends almost entirely on the ability and
tactical knowledge of the Director, the care he devotes
to the selection of the ground, the preparation
of the problem, and his own personal preparation for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the conduct of the Terrain Exercise. To this end a
study should be made of the tactical training it is
desired to impart. A problem designed to bring out
these points should be drawn up and fitted to the
ground. The successive special situations must
follow in logical sequence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director must have in his mind a solution of
the various situations of the problem and must familiarize
himself with all of its phases to the extent
that he will be able to make reasonable answer to
any question that may be propounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>He must receive all the ideas presented by the
members of the class; take out the good and tactfully
discard the poor and indifferent. He must take
care that he does not unduly criticize the members
of the class when they make mistakes and faulty
dispositions. Above all, he must never hold up a
solution to ridicule.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Preparation of the Problem</h3>

<p class='c012'>Having determined upon the tactical subject to be
studied, the next essential is a problem, clearly and
tersely stated, logically drawn and easily understood.
The several tactical situations should follow
one another in their natural sequence. Each should
bring out the tactical points that it is desired to impress
upon the members of the class. Long and
complex situations, difficult for the average man to
grasp, should be avoided. Situations should be interesting
and instructive, natural and simple.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next step is to fit the problem to a particular
section of the terrain that may be available. In this
connection it is well to draw up a tentative problem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>with its several situations. Then go out on the
ground and fit the problem to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director should carefully work out on the
ground beforehand the several situations that he
desires to develop. He should work out the details
of all possible solutions and prepare himself to discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of measures
that may be proposed by members of the class and
to state the solution that he, himself, prefers, with
the reasons therefor.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sufficient number of copies of the initial problem,
together with the special situations, should be
prepared so that a copy may be available for each
member of the class. This is a more satisfactory
method than the Director explaining them verbally.
Time is saved and misunderstandings avoided. The
special situations are numbered serially and issued
at the proper time, as the Exercise progresses. It is
a good idea to have an envelope in which to carry
the cards or slips of paper bearing each special
situation.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>General Conduct of a Terrain Exercise</h3>

<p class='c012'>The problem will ordinarily consist of a general
situation and several situations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take the class to the point where the Exercise is
to begin. Distribute copies of the problem and allow
a few minutes for the members of the class to look
over the problem and the terrain. The Director then
reads the problem aloud and points out the topographical
features and places that are referred to.
The members of the class follow from the copies in
their possession.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Questions are asked by the Director. One or more
members of the class are required to make a brief
statement of the problem, the idea being to make
certain that every man is entirely familiar with the
tactical situation under consideration. This insures
a solid foundation on which the succeeding situations
may be developed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first situation is then handed to members of
the class. The Director cautions them that each
man is to consider himself as being the commander
of the unit whose operations are to be considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The solution of the situation is then proceeded
with. This solution may be required to be reduced
to writing; it may be given orally; or a combination
of the two systems may be employed.</p>

<p class='c010'>For example: The situation involves the preparation
of a verbal field order. The Director proceeds
step by step with the details of the matter to be included
in each successive paragraph, arriving at a
decision as to just what the wording should be.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Information of the enemy and our supporting
troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Plan of the commander.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Distribution of troops and tactical order for
each element.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Administration arrangements, where applicable.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Place of commander or where messages are to
be sent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having determined upon the wording of each
paragraph, the members of the class are required to
write out the body of the order.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where the members of the class have sufficiently
progressed in their tactical training some of the preliminary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>discussion and solution may be omitted and
the men be required to write out the body of the
order based on the tactical situation. The written
solutions are collected by the Director and redistributed
to the class, taking care that no man receives
his own solution back again. This is productive
of good results, for if a man knows that his work
is to be seen by another he will put forth his best
effort and be more careful with his work. Again,
the entire solution may be given orally and nothing
reduced to writing. In this case the Director brings
out the elements by questions and discussion, and in
the end one or more members of the class are called
upon to state the contents of the body of the order.
This method is excellent for the training of officers
in the giving of verbal tactical orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>The solution having been completed, the subject
is opened up for discussion. The members of the
class are encouraged to ask questions and express
their views on the various elements under consideration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is then conducted to the place where the
next special situation is to be taken up for solution,
and here the same procedure as outlined above is
taken. The Terrain Exercise concludes with a short
conference, in which the Director makes a résumé of
the problems, discusses the several lessons of the
day, and shows the application of tactical principles
to them.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>General Rules</h3>

<p class='c012'>The following general rules should be observed as
far as practicable:</p>

<p class='c010'><i>a.</i> Weather and climatic conditions should be accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>as they actually exist on the day of the
Exercise.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>b.</i> Interest is best maintained by bringing up a
succession of instructive situations, each designed to
teach some tactical lesson, dealing with each one
concisely but thoroughly, and promptly passing on
to the next. Long discussion and personal arguments
between members of the class are to be avoided. Unimportant
phases are passed over quickly, thus allowing
the requisite amount of time to be devoted to
those that are really worth while.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>c.</i> Ordinarily four or five situations are about all
that may be profitably included in one Terrain
Exercise.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>d.</i> All members of the class should be equipped
with blank paper of uniform size (to facilitate the
handling of written solutions), message blanks, pencils,
sketching equipment for making rough sketches
on which tactical depositions may be shown.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>e.</i> Ordinarily large scale maps should not be used.
One of the valuable features of the Terrain Exercise
is that all tactical decisions and dispositions are
based on a study of the ground itself. If the members
of the class are allowed to have large scale maps,
the exercise may resolve itself into the solution of a
map problem whereby the advantage of the study of
the ground itself is detracted from.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, sheets of the United States Geological
Survey maps should, if practicable, be obtained and
issued, as it is desirable to accustom officers and non-commissioned
officers to work with small scale maps
and to familiarize them with this particular map.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>f.</i> The number of men in a class should be limited
to the number that one director is able to handle.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Terrain Exercise No. 1.</i><br /> Attack of Strong Point—Rifle Company</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>General Situation:</h3>

<p class='c012'>The (<i>a</i>) forms the boundary between hostile
States. An invading Red force was counter attacked
by Blue troops and after severe fighting the Reds
have retired. The Blue advance has been stubbornly
contested.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>Special Situation—Blue:</h3>

<p class='c012'>The Blue advance was resumed this morning. The
1st Infantry advancing on the extreme right of the
Blue line, has been held up.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a short delay, the 2nd battalion resumed its
forward movement, but attempts of the assault
waves of companies A and B (on its right) to advance
beyond (<i>b</i>) were stopped by fire from the front
and especially by enfilading machine gun fire
from (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Heavy firing—artillery and small arms—can be
heard along the line to the left. Shells fall occasionally
within and in front of the area occupied by the
1st battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lieutenant Colonel X, commanding the 1st battalion,
has arrived at this point (<i>d</i>) accompanied by
a part of his staff; Captain C, commanding the support
company C; Captain D, commanding the machine
gun company; and Lieutenant Z, commanding
a platoon of the Howitzer company, which organization
has been attached to the battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>After studying the situation in his front Lieutenant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Colonel X summoned Captains A and B, commanding
the assault companies, and issued verbal
orders for continuing the attack.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation of Letter Symbols</h4>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>) In designating the boundary line some natural
topographical feature should be selected, such as
a river, creek, canal, crest of ridge, etc. In this problem
it may be assumed that the Red invading force
has advanced several miles into Blue territory before
its advance was checked by the counter-attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) The general front occupied by the 1st battalion
where it is held up by the fire from the front
and that from the enemy strong point to the right
front. In fitting this problem to the ground care
will have to be taken to get all the features properly
coordinated. The line of departure for Company C
may be selected first and the general line of the 1st
battalion prolonged to the left. Then select the location
of the strong point with reference to the line of
departure of Company C. Cover for the deployment
of the company should be available.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) Location of the enemy strong point. This
should be some topographical feature that might be
logically occupied as a strong point by the enemy and
from which the advance of the 1st battalion might be
interfered with.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) This point should be near the center of the
front covered by the 1st battalion and should command
a view of the front. There should be reasonable
cover for the battalion commander and his staff.
In other words, it should not be so exposed to enemy
fire that the battalion commander could not go there
to make his personal reconnaissance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The class will be assembled at (<i>d</i>) where the Terrain
Exercise is to begin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the sheets containing the
problem (General Situation and Special Situation—Blue).
A few minutes are allowed the members of
the class to read over the problem after which the
Director will read it aloud and point out the places
of importance. One or more members of the class
will be called upon to state his understanding of the
tactical situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Care will be taken to indicate the right of the line
occupied by Company A and the location of the
enemy strong point will be accurately pointed out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going further into the
problem it is necessary for every member of the class
to have an accurate understanding of the formation
in which the first battalion is advancing. It is necessary
for you to visualize the situation just as it would
appear if the operation were actually taking place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The battalion is advancing in attack formation
with two companies as assault companies (Company
A is on the right and Company B on the left) and
one company (C) as battalion reserve. The front
covered is about 750 yards. The right of Company A
is at (indicate). Company C is marching about the
center of the battalion sector and about 500 yards in
rear of the front lines of the assault companies. The
1st battalion, being on the right of the Blue line has
a combat patrol of one squad from the battalion reserve
covering the right flank. This patrol is advancing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>about 150 yards to the right and rear of the
assault echelon. A connecting group of two or three
men also from the reserve company, maintains communication
with the 2nd battalion on the left. As the
reserve company may be called into action at any
moment, these detachments are taken from the support
platoon of the company, the 3rd. The battalion
commander and his staff march between the assault
echelon and the reserve company.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the battalion was held up by the enemy, information
of this fact was sent back to Lieutenant
Colonel X by the commanders of the assault companies
and it was also brought back by the battalion
intelligence scouts who are with the assault companies.
On receipt of the information Lieutenant
Colonel X came forward to this point to ascertain
the situation and by a personal reconnaissance, see it
for himself. Accompanying him were his staff officers
Bn-2; Bn-3, Captains C and D; and Lieutenant
Z. This is the situation in which we find the battalion
commander at the beginning of this Terrain
Exercise. I hope every member of the class understands
this formation and all the details of it. If
there are any doubts about it now is the time to clear
them up. If there are no questions we will proceed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will now distribute the sheets bearing
Situation No. 1.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain C, commanding Company C, the battalion
reserve, took down the following notes from
the battalion commander’s orders:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“The 1st battalion will resume its advance, attacking
the enemy in front and enveloping his left, including the
strong point.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Time of attack—signal from battalion commander.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Line of departure—present front line.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Companies A and B make frontal attack covering
present front of 750 yards. Company A, Base Company.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Company C will attack the strong point, enveloping
its left.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“One platoon company D and the 1st platoon Howitzer
Company will support the attack of Company C. Captain
D and Lieutenant Z will confer with Captain C regarding
the assistance to be rendered.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Captain C will notify the battalion commander when
he is ready to attack.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The attack will be pushed hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain C, have with you three platoon runners
and two company runners.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Your action and orders during the next 20 minutes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>A few minutes are allowed the members of the
class to look over the situation. It is then read aloud
and the necessary explanations made.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what is the
formation of Company C, at the time the battalion
commander’s order is received by Captain C?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “The formation would depend
upon the cover available, the distance from the
front line and the class of fire it is being subjected to.
In this case I should say that the company will be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>dispersed formation either in squad columns or platoon
columns. I would prefer the platoon columns
because they are more easily controlled. I think I
would have each platoon in a platoon column. The
first and second platoons would march abreast with
an interval of at least 40 yards with the third platoon
marching about 50 yards to the rear and opposite the
interval between the first and second. Company
headquarters would be in the lead.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a very good formation
under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director should prepare an answer to this question
based on the lay of the ground.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you arrive at the interval of 40 yards between
the two leading platoons?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “That is about the minimum
distance to avoid casualties in more than one column
from the burst of one shell and it is about the maximum
distance for control and visibility in the
woods.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, let us assume
that you are Captain C. You have received the
orders of the battalion commander. What is your
mission?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “To attack the enemy’s strong
point enveloping its left.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “In sizing up the situation what
points would you consider?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would consider the enemy’s
position, and if possible, go to a point where I can
make a personal reconnaissance of it. I would consider
the route by which I can get my company up to
the point where I can make the attack and select the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>line of departure for the company. I will then decide
upon my plan of maneuver and the formation
of the company for attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “In other words, you will make an
Estimate of the Situation and upon this you will base
your decision and in turn your orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Yes, sir. That is the idea.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I want to emphasize the necessity
for this process of sizing up the situation on the part
of all officers charged with a tactical operation. If
you come to a decision without doing so you may be
right and you may be wrong. The chances are
greatly in favor of the latter. If you stop and consider
the elements of the problem as outlined by Captain
Hastings the chances are that you will be right.
In any event you have the odds on your side. Lieutenant
Wallace, what troops have been designated to
support your company?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “A part of the machine gun
company and a howitzer platoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You will note that these two units
have been ordered to support your attack. They are
not attached to your company. What do you understand
to be the difference between a supporting unit
and an attached unit?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “An attached unit becomes
an integral part of the force and is subject to its commander’s
orders. A supporting unit receives its
orders, not from the commander of the force being
supported, but from another source, usually a common
superior.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is right. I hope you all note
the distinction. It is the rule, however, that the supporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>unit must work with the unit that it is supporting
in every way possible so as to insure teamwork
in the accomplishment of the common mission.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Ralston, how would you get your instructions
to your platoon leaders, who are back with
the company?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I have a runner with me
from each of the three platoons. I would send these
runners back to their respective platoons to tell the
platoon commanders to report to me at ___________”
(Lieutenant Ralston would indicate where the platoon
commanders are to report.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us assume that you are Captain
C. Just what would you say to the runners?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would call the platoon
runners to me and say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Do you see that ___________?’ (Designating a
tree or other well defined object.) ‘Each platoon runner
will deliver this message to his platoon leader—Platoon
leaders will join Captain C at once at ___________
(Place). Repeat the message.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Now let us assume that
the platoon runners have started back to their platoons,
what would you do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would go over to the right
to make a personal reconnaissance of the enemy
strong point, select my line of departure for the attack
and get the ‘line-up’ of the supporting weapons.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That would seem to be the reasonable
thing to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Class is now conducted over to the right, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a point about the center of the line of departure for
the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, let us assume
that you have come to this point. You have with you
the commanders of the machine gun company, Captain
D, and the Howitzer platoon, Lieutenant Z.
You decide that the line of departure for your attack
shall be along here (indicating). What instructions
would you give to Captain D and Lieutenant Z?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would indicate to them where
I want the machine guns, light mortars, and one-pounders to be located to support the attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You would tell exactly where to
place the weapons, would you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, do you agree with
that solution to the problem?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “No, sir, I do not. It seems to
me that it would be better for Captain C to indicate
to Captain D and Lieutenant Z the dispositions that
he proposes to make—where the line of departure is
to be and the direction of the attack. Then to leave
it up to those officers to select the firing positions for
the weapons. I think Captain C would verify the
positions selected, but he would at least give the men
who are supposed to be the experts an opportunity
to use their knowledge of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. I believe in
requiring every man to do his job. These officers
have been ordered to support the attack. It is up to
them to select the position where they can get the
best fire effect with their weapons and to get them
into position ready to do business.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“What precautions would you take to indicate the
place where the platoon leaders are to assemble,
Captain James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would send one of my company
runners to the assembly point and order him to tell
the platoon leaders to wait there for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that is a wise precaution.
You do not want to take a chance on anything going
wrong and failing to effect an assembly of the platoon
leaders.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, let us consider how the attack is to be made.
What would be your tactical dispositions, Captain
James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would attack with one Platoon
(the first), advancing directly against the enemy
strong point, and another (the second) working
around the enemy’s left flank and enveloping it. I
would hold the remaining platoon (the third) as
company support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Where is your line of departure?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “My line of departure would be
along here. The right of the first platoon would be
(indicate). The left of the second platoon will be
(indicate). Each platoon will cover about 150 yards
of front. The third platoon will follow in rear of the
second platoon as company support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a logical disposition.
Now having decided all of this you should
give the information to Captain D and Lieutenant X
so they can go about the task of selecting positions
for their weapons. How would you do this, Lieutenant
Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “Assuming that Lieutenant Z
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and Captain D have been with me all the while, I
would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘My first platoon will attack with its right about (indicate).
The second platoon with its left about (indicate).
Each will cover a front of about 150 yards. Select your
firing positions to cover the attack.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is all that should be required. Before issuing
final orders for the attack I would verify the
positions selected.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: I hope you have all followed the process
that we have gone through during the 20 minutes,
in order to arrive at a decision and the point
where Captain C is ready to issue his orders for the
attack. Let us review them briefly:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Send for the platoon commanders to come to
the front.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Accompanied by Captain D and Lieutenant Z,
and two runners, make a personal reconnaissance of
the enemy’s position and the terrain and determine:</p>

<p class='c019'>(<i>a</i>) The line of departure.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<i>b</i>) The tactical formation.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<i>c</i>) Direction of the attack.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<i>d</i>) The position of the supporting weapons.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Arrange for a rendezvous where the attack
order can be issued.</p>

<p class='c010'>From all of this you will appreciate that there are
many things that must be done before an attack of
this kind can be launched. Battalion and other commanders
should appreciate that it takes time to do
all of these things and should have patience with the
officers whom he has ordered to do it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes the sheets bearing Situation
No. 2, reads it aloud and makes such explanation
as may be necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going further with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>problem I desire to again call your attention to the
five paragraph field order that we use in our service.
This form of field order was evolved before the war
and used in our service schools. It is prescribed by
our Field Service Regulations. When we entered
the war and our troops went to France we found on
both the British and French fronts a system of field
orders that did not agree with our American ideas.
The orders were most voluminous. They went into
every detail of procedure and left little to the initiative
of the commanders of tactical units. The consequence
was that many of these commanders lost
their initiative. When their orders ran out and
nothing further had been prescribed for them to do,
they just naturally did not know what to do and
stopped until more orders were sent up to them. I
am not so sure but what this system was responsible
in the proposition of limited objectives that we found
when we entered into the campaign. Many of our
own officers fell for the voluminous order system but
it did not last long after we got into action. It was
then abandoned and we reverted to our own five
paragraph order which filled the bill and met all our
requirements. You remember that after an attack
started and was seen to be under way, how quickly
orders came up to disregard all objectives and push
on. Our own simple field order system stood the test
of war and I do not think it will ever be abandoned
again for any other system.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The paragraphs of the order include:</p>

<p class='c010'>1st paragraph:—Information of the enemy and
our own troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>2nd paragraph:—The plans of the commander.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>3rd paragraph:—Disposition of troops. Orders
for each element of the command and the tactical instructions
that pertain to all elements.</p>

<p class='c010'>4th paragraph:—Administrative arrangements.</p>

<p class='c010'>5th paragraph:—Where messages are to be sent
or location of the command post.</p>

<p class='c010'>In preparing the order for the attack under the requirement
to our Situation No. 2, I wish you would
use this form of order.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, just what would you
include in the first paragraph of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would include the information
about the enemy holding up our attack and the part
that his strong point has played with the affair. I
would include information of the fact that our second
battalion is resuming the advance and how the
rest of our battalion is to attack. That is all that
would be necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would you include in the second
paragraph?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “My plan—To attack the enemy
strong point enveloping its left.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, tell us what you
would include in the third paragraph?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would include orders for
the machine guns, the light mortars and the 37 mm.
guns; orders for the assault platoons, indicating the
troops, line of departure, frontage and the objective;
orders for the support platoon; orders for covering
and connecting patrols; indicate the base platoon;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>orders for the action to be taken when the enemy
strong point is captured.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “There will be very little to be provided
for in an administrative way. The location of
the battalion aid station should be noted and if there
are any instructions regarding extra ammunition,
it should be included here. The C. P. of the company
will be near the support platoon and this information
should be placed in the last paragraph of
the order.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now I want each member of the
class to write out the order of Captain C for the
attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The necessary time is allowed for this and after
the orders are completed they are collected and again
distributed to the members of the class, making sure
that no man gets his own order back again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Members of the class are called upon to read the
order in his possession and it is discussed.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the conclusion of this the Director will submit
the following order for discussion:</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Order</h4>

<p class='c022'>“The enemy has held up the advance of our battalion
by fire from that (ridge, edge of woods or other feature)
and especially by machine gun fire from that enemy strong
point (describe and indicate location of the enemy strong
point). The second battalion on our left has resumed
its advance. Our battalion will attack. Companies A
and B will advance from their present positions on our
left and attack the enemy in their front (indicate the
present positions of Companies A and B).</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our Company will attack and capture the enemy
strong point, enveloping its left.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“The first platoon Company D, will support our advance
by direct overhead machine gun fire from (indicate
firing position of the machine guns).</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 1st platoon howitzer company will support our advance
with light mortar fire from (indicate firing position
of light mortars) and 37 mm. gun fire from (indicate firing
position of the 37 mm. gun).</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lieutenant M. with the 1st platoon, will attack the
front of the enemy strong point. Line of departure (indicate).
Frontage about 150 yards from that (designate)
to that (designate). Objective enemy strong point. Direction
______ degrees, magnetic.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lieutenant O, with the 2nd platoon, will attack and
envelop the left of the enemy strong point. Line of departure
(indicate). Frontage, about 150 yards, left of
platoon at (indicate). Route of advance (designate).
Objective enemy left.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lieutenant P, with the 3rd platoon (less detachments),
will constitute the Company support and await orders
(indicate where—should be in rear of the 2nd platoon).
A combat patrol will be sent out to cover the right flank.
A connecting group of two men will maintain connection
with the right of Company A on our left.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 1st platoon, base platoon.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After capture the enemy’s strong point will be immediately
organized for defense.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The battalion aid station is at a point 700 yards in
rear of Company A.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Messages to the support platoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After issuing the order Captain C will say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is now ____ o’clock, set your watches to agree.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Join your platoons. Get them up to the line of departure.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Notify me at this point when you are ready to attack.
Begin the attack at my signal.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will distribute mimeograph copies of
this order to the members of the class. He will read
the order. The members of the class follow from the
copy in their possession. He will point out the features
of the terrain referred to in the order as he
reads it and make such comment and explanation as
may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You now see what the order for an
attack of an infantry company must contain. If you
omit any of these things the order is not complete.
Note how the order conforms to the requirements of
our Field Service Regulations. Are there any questions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I note that the 1st and 2nd
platoons are to attack on a front of about 150 yards.
How does a platoon cover such a front?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The normal interval between
skirmishers is 5 paces. This should be adhered to
rigidly in extended order drill. Men will, under the
stress of danger and excitement, do as they have been
trained. In spite of the injunction of the Infantry
Drill Regulations, I would not change this interval
in drill for it may lead to bunching and the consequent
loss of lives in action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The platoon fights in two waves with a section in
each wave. This gives a wave and consequently a
platoon a front of 120 yards in action. Where a
larger front than 120 yards is assigned to a platoon
to cover, the platoon is placed at about the center of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the front and held responsible for the interval on
each flank to the boundary of the zone of action assigned.
The support section forming the second
wave, following at a convenient distance, is used by
the platoon leader in any required part of the platoon
zone of action as the situation develops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In rare instances a platoon may be deployed with
both sections on one line, covering a front of 240
yards. Such a line is very difficult for the platoon
leader to control and is to be avoided.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I note the designation of a
‘base platoon’ in Captain C.’s orders. What is the
significance of that in a converging attack, such as is
contemplated?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “A Base Platoon is designated only
as an aid to the initial formation of the company.
During an approach march, in deploying on the line
of departure and in advancing to the first firing position,
the base platoon forms the guide for the company
and helps ensure a coordinated attack. But as
soon as enemy opposition is met, each platoon makes
its own fight within its own zone of action and all
consideration of the ‘base platoon’ is dropped. In
action, each platoon must observe the action of adjacent
units and be prepared to assist them. But the
best possible aid consists in the vast majority of
cases, in pushing ahead, ‘where the pushing is good’
and then threatening in the flank or rear enemy resistances
holding up adjacent units.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In this case, the ‘first firing position’ may be very
close to, or even coincide with the Line of Departure,
so that the base platoon designation is of especial
value in the initial deployment.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Will the Director please discuss
the personnel of the headquarters of Company
C in action—its positions and formations?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “A rifle company headquarters in
action consists of:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. The Captain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. First Sergeant, Signal Sergeant, Agents from
the supporting Machine Gun unit (platoon or company),
and two company runners all following in two
short columns behind the captain. When halted
these men take cover within reach of the captain’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. Two buglers, one well to the left flank observing
the connecting group keeping connection with
Company A and the other observing combat patrol
covering the right. These buglers will report to the
Captain any item of information they note.</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. Three platoon runners, arranged in a rough
triangle each between his own platoon and the company
headquarters. These runners keep within call
or signaling distance of the Captain and each knows
always the position of his own platoon. By these
runners the Captain communicates with his three
platoons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“5. Two Company runners at the Battalion Command
Post. These runners keep track of the position
of their own company and are prepared to take
messages to it from Battalion headquarters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The position of Company Headquarters is such
that the Captain can maintain connection with his
assault platoons, observe the progress of the fight
personally and especially be ready to throw his support
platoon into the action when and where most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>needed. During the approach the Captain precedes
his assault echelon. When the fire opens, Company
Headquarters drops back to a position between the
assault echelon and the support platoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Where is the second in command
of the company? There is no mention of him
in the orders.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes, I am glad you noted the omission.
The senior Lieutenant, or ‘second-in-command’
remains back at the Company rear echelon
during a fight. Here he is responsible that ammunition
is forwarded as necessary, that meals are prepared
and that all men drifting to the rear are held.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Further, as the casualties among rifle company
officers are higher than in any other unit in the entire
army, keeping this officer out of the fight ensures
a trained officer to replace the Captain, in case the
latter becomes a casualty and to reorganize the company
after each battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whenever the Captain becomes incapacitated for
any reason a runner is sent at once from Company
Headquarters back to the rear echelon and the second
in command hastens forward to take command
of the company. The first sergeant or others of the
personnel at Company Headquarters acquaint him
with the situation. It is considered most important
to have this trained officer in reserve ready to take
command on short notice.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “Where will the combat patrol
on the right flank march?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “It will march well out on the right
flank and rear of the 2nd platoon, so that if an enemy
machine gun or patrol fires on the platoon from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>direction the patrol will be in position to attack it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “The Director mentioned something
about extra ammunition. I did not understand
what was said?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All riflemen of the units of an assault
battalion should carry an extra bandolier of
ammunition when they go into action. This applies
to the battalion reserve company as well as the assault
companies. You can see in this case how delay
would be occasioned by stopping to issue extra ammunition
to the men.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “It is noted that you give orders
for the consolidation and preparation of the enemy
strong point for defense as soon as it is captured.
Just what is the purpose of this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “At this time Captain C cannot tell
just what will happen when he gets into the enemy
strong point. That is the objective of the attack for
the time being. He would want the platoon commanders
to have orders that will carry them until
he can get up there and decide what to do. The Company
may not stop at the strong point. If the enemy
is on the run they will follow him up probably. This
will depend upon the action of the rest of the battalion.
In any event we will want a position on
which to reorganize the company and prepare for
future eventualities and by preparing the position
for defense we gain such a position and at the same
time we are ready to meet a counter-attack if it
comes.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going further with the
problem I want to explain to you what happens between
the time the Captain issues his orders for the
attack and the time that it starts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Having received and understood their orders, the
platoon commanders go back and join their platoons.
In doing so they select the route over which they are
going to conduct their commands up to the line of departure
for the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Each platoon commander conducts his platoon
over to the right and gets it into approach formation
directly in rear of and with its front as nearly parallel
to the line of departure as possible. The proposition
of bringing a platoon or any other unit up to
a point immediately in rear of the line of departure
in a column of files and making the deployment from
that formation is fraught with great danger and is
almost sure to result in confusion, losses and great
consumption of time. The platoons must be gotten
into an approach formation from which they can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>readily deploy on nearing the line of departure. Captain
James, suppose you were commanding the first
platoon. What formation would you take up in
bringing your platoon up to the line of departure?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would form it in two lines or
waves each consisting of one section. Each section
would be in line of squad columns. From this formation
I can readily deploy the leading wave in to a
line of skirmishes covering the front allotted to the
platoon and hold the rear wave in a line of squad
columns or deploy it as the circumstances may require.
In any event I have my platoon under complete
control all the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we can all agree that your
formation is correct.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, each platoon commander must get the orders
to the men who are to make the attack. When the
platoon arrives at a point in rear of the line of departure
the platoon commanders will assemble their
non-commissioned officers and scouts at a covered location
near the line of departure where they can
command a view of the front. Here he will explain
the situation and give his orders for the attack.
These orders will be issued in the regular five paragraph
order form which I have already explained to
you. The non-commissioned officers join their units.
The leading wave is brought up and deployed on the
line of departure. The scouts move out to the front.
The second section is held in proper formation (line
of squad columns or line of skirmishers) from 50 to
100 yards in rear of the leading wave. The platoon
commanders signal Captain C that they are ready to
launch the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“The special weapons, machine guns and light mortars
and the 37 mm. gun, are gotten to their respective
firing positions and the unit commanders signal
Captain C that they are ready to cover the attacking
troops with their fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The company support platoon is conducted to its
position in rear of the second platoon and the platoon
commander signals that he is ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain C then signals the battalion commander
that he is all ready to launch the attack. When he
gets the signal from the battalion commander, he signals
the supporting weapon commanders and the
platoon commanders to proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, you may say that all of this sounds well in
theory, but, you ask, how is it done in actual practice?
What is the enemy doing all this time? I ask
you to visualize the situation from the enemy point
of view. What would you be doing if you were in
his place? You occupy a strong point on the left of
your line. You have been placed there to protect the
flank and to bring machine gun fire to bear on our attacking
troops to your right. The attack is progressing
off to your right. The firing seems to be getting
further and further to your rear. You have fears
that the line is not holding. You have visions of being
left to your fate. You get no information of
what is taking place over there. In your own immediate
front there is little doing. You see nothing
to indicate what we are doing over here. You have
no well defined target to fire on. A few scouts are
seen off to the right oblique (scouts of Companies A
and B). There is nothing in your front that would
afford you a target. The scouts that you send out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>from the strong point run into our covering patrol
and either become casualties or are driven back.
Your strength does not permit sending out a reconnoitering
party of sufficient strength to break
through and get any real information of what is
taking place in your front. You simply have to sit
and wait for something to develop. I am sure if
you will place yourself in the enemy’s position at
this time, you must realize his situation and the conflicting
thoughts that come across his mind. He is
just a human as you are. He is just as much afraid.
He has just the same feeling about the danger of
the situation as you have, only his situation is worse
than yours. He must sit and wait for something to
happen while your activities and preparations occupy
your thoughts and attention. You have the
initiative, you lead and he must follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you consider all of these things you will see
how it is possible to go about the preparation process
in a comparatively deliberate manner. If you have
fairly good cover from the fire and view of the enemy
it is not at all difficult.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The greatest danger in all of this is from our own
side. From the impatience of our own higher commanders
who think the preparations are taking too
much time. Brigade and regimental commanders
who are to the rear and cannot see what is going on
get impatient with the apparent delays and demand
that the attack be delivered at once. Even the battalion
commander, who is up at the front and ought
to know better, cannot see how you can possibly consume
so much time getting ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is one of the valuable features of these Terrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Exercises. They illustrate and demonstrate to
officers of all ranks that a certain amount of time
must be allowed a combat unit to get ready to launch
an attack and that they may as well sit down and
take it easy until everything is ready. The war is
not to be fought in a day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us take our problem as an example. Our
Company (C) could be brought up and rushed into
action in its attack on the enemy strong point.
The rifleman would have fought it out with his bare
hands, so to speak. There would be no supporting
fire from machine guns, light mortars and one-pounders. It would have been a direct frontal attack,
with no enveloping movement. The chances
are that it would be a complete failure and the whole
affair would have to be reorganized and done over
again. Even if it were successful it would be accompanied
by ruinous losses that would render the company
totally ineffective for further combat service in
the near future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By going about the preparations systematically,
as we have done, the chances for success are infinitely
greater, the losses will be very much smaller and in
the long run, a lot of time saved. I hope you will
all consider these things when you give orders to a
unit under your command, be it a battalion or a
small patrol, to embark upon a tactical undertaking.
Give the commander time to perfect his preparations.
Do not rush him into action until he is ready.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted up to the line of departure
of the platoon. The Director distributes the
sheets containing Situation No. 3.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 3:</b></p>

<p class='c010'>The 1st platoon is deployed on the line of departure—one
section in the leading wave in a line of
skirmishers, with intervals of 5 yards. The second
section is about 100 yards to the rear in line of squad
columns. The platoon scouts have worked their
way forward to _______ (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'>The supporting troops are in position ready to
open fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment Captain C signals “Forward
March”. The supporting weapons open fire on the
enemy strong point and shots are heard off to the
right indicating that the 2nd platoon has launched
its attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant M, commanding the 1st platoon,
are at this point when the signal is received.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Describe how the attack is conducted.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads over the situation and indicates
the position of the troops on the ground. Any
points that may be in doubt are cleared up at this
time.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, I wish you
would explain to the class, just what you think takes
place.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “During the preparation process
my platoon scouts would have worked their way
forward to (indicate on the ground). I assume
that they have kept under cover and have drawn little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>fire from the enemy. The instant I give my signal
to advance they will start forward to get to (indicate)
where they can open an effective fire on the
enemy and thus establish the first firing position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When our supporting weapons open their first
burst of fire on the enemy strong point it will come
as a surprise and his men will naturally seek cover.
I will take advantage of this fact to advance my line
as far as possible to the front. If he opens effective
fire I will have to take cover. If not I will keep on
my rush with the platoon until he does and thus take
advantage of the few moments when the enemy is
surprised from the sudden burst of fire from our
supporting weapons. When he recovers and opens
fire I will take cover.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will then advance my men by filtration up to the
line established by the scouts, each man opening fire
as soon as he arrives on the line. The scouts will
indicate the target to the men by the use of tracer
bullets. By this process of fire and movement, I
will build up my firing line and keep up a well directed
fire on the enemy position.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What kind of fire will your automatic
riflemen employ?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “They will employ aimed fire,
semi-automatic.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “About what is the rate of this fire
with well trained automatic riflemen?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I should say that it would be
about 30 to 40 shots per minute.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Class is now conducted to the point where the
first fire position is located.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, the first section is
along this front firing on the enemy strong point.
They are returning the fire, the volume of which is

had a few casualties. What would you do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “By a process of fire and movement
I would work my section further to the front and
build up a new firing line ________ (indicate the location
of the new line).”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would your second section
be doing?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “It would be following the advance
ready to join the firing line when I call upon it to do
so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is now conducted up to the new fire position.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The line has worked forward to
this position with a few more casualties. It is apparent
that the enemy’s fire is increasing in volume
and you find that it will be impossible for you to continue
the advance. In other words you cannot attain
fire superiority with your present force on the
firing line. What would you do about that, Lieutenant
Barry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would signal the section
“Fire Faster” and under cover of this increased
volume of fire I would bring my 2nd section up onto
the line, and have the men join in the firing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The solution of all the above will depend upon the
lay of the ground where the Terrain Exercise is staged. The
points to be brought out by the Director are that the first wave
will continue its advance by its own efforts as far to the front
as possible. When it cannot longer maintain the superiority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>fire necessary to enable it to continue, the 2nd section must be
brought up and continue the forward movement. When the
2nd section has joined the 1st on the line the subsequent progress
of the action will depend upon how well the superiority
of fire can be maintained. If the volume is such that the
enemy can be kept down and prevented from firing effectively
the advance can be continued, by the utilization of fire and
movement. Ordinarily the enemy will realize the hopelessness
of the situation and evacuate his position before it is necessary
to carry it by assault.)</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain C, have come forward to this point.
You see your assault platoons covered by their own
fire and that of the supporting weapons advancing
rapidly on the enemy strong point. They are now
(indicate the general line that each platoon occupies.)
The volume of fire of the enemy has materially
decreased. You note that the supporting weapons
have lifted their fire and are now firing well
beyond the strong point. A few moments later you
note that both platoons rush towards the strong point
with bayonets fixed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 3rd platoon has now arrived at the line of departure
of the 2nd platoon. Companies A and B
seem to be carrying out their attack on your left;
there is no machine gun fire to interfere with them
now.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Required.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>What do you, Captain C, do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes the sheets bearing Situation
No. 4 to the class, reads it aloud to them, points
out the location of the troops and makes any verbal
explanations that may be necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “I want each member of the class to
visualize the situation as it now stands. In the beginning
Captain C assigned definite missions to each
of his platoons. He left the essential details to the
platoon commanders. He is driving a team of two
units with a third held in reserve. His team has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>been driven into the enemy’s position. They have
accomplished the main part of their mission and
something more is necessary on the part of the Captain.
Lieutenant Barry, knowing the situation as
it is, what would you do?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would go forward and join
my two platoons at the enemy strong point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you take any other action
before doing that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I think not, sir. I would want
to know the situation up there as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would you do, Lieutenant
Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would send a messenger back
to the 3rd platoon to get started on its way to the
captured position.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Just how would you do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would turn to the runner of
the 3rd platoon, who is with me and tell him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Take this message to the leader of the 3rd platoon:
‘The 3rd platoon will report to Captain C at the enemy
strong point at once, moving by the shortest route.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would have the runner repeat the message and
make sure that he, himself, understands what is
wanted.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. There is no doubt
but that the presence of the 3rd platoon will be required
at the enemy position just as soon as it can
be gotten up there. The assault platoons will be
more or less disorganized by their attack. They will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>be out of hand. Squads, sections and platoons will
be mixed up. There will be some hand to hand fighting
with some of the enemy who have failed to make
their get-away or with some determined men who
will hold on to their local position until they are
driven out with cold steel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is to provide for just such a situation as this,
that we hold out a reserve—a formed body of troops
that has not been in the assault. A body that is absolutely
in hand and under control. It can be conducted
up to the enemy position, take it over and be ready
for any eventuality that may occur.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As a matter of fact the assault troops should not
be allowed to go into the captured position unless it
is absolutely necessary to do so to drive out or capture
those remaining. The reasons for this are obvious.
When the enemy abandons the position, he
assumes that it is occupied by his opponent and will
turn as great a volume of fire on it as possible with
a view to inflicting losses on our disorganized troops.
With a formed body of troops, under control, we
can make such tactical distribution of the units as
may be required, posting them where the greatest
amount of shelter exists and thereby reduce casualties
to a minimum.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, let us assume
that you have sent back the message to the commander
of the 3rd platoon. What would you do
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would go forward and
join my assault platoons.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you do anything about getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>some of the special weapons up to the captured
position?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “No sir, not yet. It is my
understanding that the machine gun and howitzer
platoons were only detailed with Company C to support
the attack on the enemy strong point. At the
conclusion of the affair that they are to report back
to the battalion commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. If, however, Captain
C decides that he needs them he can send a runner
to the battalion commander and request that they
be detailed for further duty with the company.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 5</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>On arriving at the captured strong point, Captain
C finds the 1st and 2nd platoons somewhat mixed up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and disorganized. Some of the men are on the far
side firing on the retreating enemy. Some are seen
to be hunting souvenirs. There are a considerable
number of enemy dead and wounded lying about.
About a dozen enemy prisoners are standing off to
one side with their hands up.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 3rd platoon is seen advancing in the distance.
Lieutenant P, with the platoon headquarters is coming
forward at a run.</p>

<p class='c010'>Companies A and B to the left are advancing and
the whole enemy line is apparently retreating.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Required.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Captain C, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes the sheets bearing the situation
to the class, reads it over and makes the necessary
explanations, points out the places mentioned,
etc.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what would you
do under the circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “In the first place I would want
to see the platoon commanders and give them instructions
as to the action to be taken. I would call the
runners of the 1st and 2nd platoons and order them:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Find your platoon commanders. Tell them to report
to me here, at once.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“While waiting for the platoon commanders to
come I would size up the situation and be prepared
to issue my orders soon after their arrival.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we can all agree that that
is the logical procedure. In sizing up the situation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>what points would you consider, Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would consider what my
mission is now. The company is the battalion reserve.
It was thrown into the attack for the definite
purpose of capturing the enemy strong point that
was holding up the advance of the battalion. We
have completed that mission, the battalion is continuing
the advance. Up to the moment no other
mission has been assigned. I would not know
whether it is the desire of the battalion commander
that we continue the advance as an assault unit of
the battalion or revert to the former status of battalion
reserve. Until I receive definite orders on the
subject I would stay right here and cover the right
flank of the battalion. I estimate that I will get
such orders in a very short time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The enemy has several courses of action open to
him. He may continue to fall back and not molest
us. He may make a counter-attack, though this is
not probable. He may concentrate a large volume
of fire on this particular point with a view to causing
serious casualties in our disorganized ranks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our own battalion is continuing its advance and
does not seem to need our support for the time being.
The 1st and 2nd platoons must be withdrawn and
reorganized. The 3rd platoon can take over the duty
of security. The enemy prisoners must be taken
care of and others that may be in the position must
be rounded up. Souvenir hunters and stragglers
must be rounded up and sent to their proper units.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“The sanitary troops are now taking care of our
wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The battalion commander will want to know what
has happened on our front and I would send him a
message telling him about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My decision would be to withdraw and reorganize
the 1st and 2nd platoons. Have the 3rd platoon
take over the duty of security, mop up the position
and take charge of the prisoners. Send a message
to the battalion commander.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All of this would constitute my hurried estimate
of the situation. When the platoon commanders assemble
I will give the necessary orders to put my
decision into effect.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. Now, Lieutenant
Ralston, let us assume that the platoon commanders
are assembled and you are ready to give them
their orders. What is the first thing you would do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would want to get my report
off to the battalion commander as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Just how would you do this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would write it out and
send it by a runner.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you think you would take the
time to do that? You have your first sergeant with
you. He should be able to write out the message and
I think you would have him do it. That leaves you
free to go ahead with your orders to the platoon
commanders. You would indicate roughly what you
want to go into the message to the battalion commander
and leave the rest to the first sergeant. Now,
tell us what you would include in the orders to the
platoon commanders, Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would give the orders about
as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The other companies of our battalion are advancing
on our left.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This company will reorganize and prepare for further
service.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 3rd platoon will relieve the firing line with one
section and take over the security of the position. Have
the men of the 1st and 2nd platoons fall back and assemble
by squads on this side (indicate) of the position.
The remaining section will take charge of the prisoners,
mop up the position, collect other prisoners and stragglers.
The covering patrol of one squad will remain out on the
right.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 1st platoon will assemble at (indicate place).</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 2nd platoon will assemble at (indicate place).</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 1st and 2nd platoons will reorganize, check casualties
and report results. Secure ammunition from dead
and wounded.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Messages to me here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that order will meet the immediate
requirements of the situation. Now, Captain
Hodges, what would you include in the message
to the battalion commander?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would make it very brief.
Something to this effect:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Enemy strong point captured at ____ (Time). My
casualties about ____, killed; ____ wounded. Prisoners
____ (number). Am reorganizing. (Such additional information
about enemy that would be of value to the Battalion
commander). Await your further instructions.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that message will give the
battalion commander all the information that he requires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>immediately. It informs him of the fact that
you have accomplished your mission. It tells him
how many casualties you have had which will enable
him to determine the further effective strength of the
company and what it is capable of doing in the future.
It tells him what you are now doing and indicates
that further instructions are desired. His
reaction should be to send you instructions what to
do, either to continue to the front as an assault unit
of the battalion or to revert to the role of battalion
reserve. Now, I want each member of the class to
write out the orders of Captain C and the message
that he would send to the battalion commander. Follow
out the five paragraph order system.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>When the orders and the message are complete
they will be collected and redistributed. One or
more members of the class will be called upon to read
the order and message in his possession and to criticize
it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “This situation concludes the Terrain
Exercise. I hope that it has been valuable to all
of you and has brought out some points that will
stand you well in hand if you ever be called upon to

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class='c010'>The attacking brigade is disposed regiments side
by side, the —— Infantry in the right half of the
sector: the —— Infantry in the left half of the sector.
Regiments are echeloned by battalion; one as
assault; one as support and one as reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>The —— Infantry has the 2nd battalion as assault;
the 1st battalion as support and the 3rd battalion as
reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>After an all day fight the assault battalion (2nd)
has halted along (<i>d</i>) where it has been ordered to
stabilize for the night in order to permit arrangements
to be made for the continuation of the attack
tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>The support battalion (1st) has reached (<i>e</i>) where
it is halted.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) The general location of the front lines of the

<p class='c012'>The class is conducted to (<i>e</i>) where the Terrain

the sheets containing Special Situation Blue and a
few minutes are allowed the members of the class to
read it over.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will then read the Situation aloud,
point out the places mentioned where practicable and
make such explanations as may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, the situation
states that the 10th division is operating on a certain
sector. What do you understand by that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “It is the area lying between
the two designated boundaries which has been
allotted to the division and to which, in general, the
division confines its operations. As I understand it
there is a division on our right and another on our
left. If each were not given a definite area to operate
over I can readily see how there might be great
confusion over the question as to just who is responsible
for a certain area. By assigning definite boundaries
this question is eliminated. The division assigned
to the particular sector is responsible for
everything in the sector.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what do you
understand by the term attacking brigade?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “It is the term used to designate
the Brigade that is leading—the brigade that is
making the attack against the enemy—as distinguished
from the brigade that is held in reserve.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “There are several ways of disposing
the infantry of a division for combat. I will
outline them briefly in order that you may see what
the formations are and the relation that our battalion
has to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The division may be deployed with the two brigades
side by side, each brigade being echeloned in a
column of regiments. The leading regiment of each
brigade is in turn echeloned in a column of battalions,
one as assault, one as support and one as local reserve.
The second regiment (less 1 battalion) of
each brigade forms the brigade reserve. The remaining
battalion from each of these regiments is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>held out by the division commander as a division reserve.
In this case the division commander is driving
a two unit team with the units abreast. Under
exceptional circumstances the division may be deployed
with the brigades side by side with all four
regiments in line each echeloned in a column of battalions.
This formation uses up a division very rapidly
and is only employed where an exceptionally
wide front has been assigned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The third method of deployment is that indicated
in the problem we have under consideration. There
is an attacking brigade with the regiments side by
side, each regiment echeloned in a column of battalions,
one as attacking, one as support and one as
reserve. This is a very good formation and has
many advantages. It is one that was employed by
many of the successful divisions in France. The
Reserve brigade is held far back in order to reduce
fatigue and casualties to a minimum, so that when it
is called upon to relieve the attacking brigade it is in
the best of condition and comparatively fresh and
rested. In this formation the division commander
drives his team of units in tandem. Now, I want
every member of the class to visualize this formation
and get it firmly fixed in your minds. Let us review
it again:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our brigade, the 19th is the attacking Brigade.
We have our two regiments abreast. Our regiment
occupies the —— half of the sector which extends
right up through here (indicates); the other regiment
occupies the —— half of the sector which extends
right along parallel to us along there (indicating).
Our 2nd battalion has been the assault battalion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and has carried the advance forward today.
We have been following as support battalion, and at
the end of the day’s work have arrived here. Our
3rd battalion has been following us at a distance of
about 1,000 yards as the reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The 1st battalion has gotten as far forward as it
possibly can today and has halted along the ________
(indicate the general line of the battalion) where it
has been ordered to stabilize for the night in order to
permit arrangements to be made for continuing the
advance tomorrow morning. The problem of this
Terrain Exercise has to do with those arrangements,
in so far as the Infantry is concerned. We are the
support battalion, it is up to us to relieve the assault
battalion tonight and carry on the fight tomorrow.
How are we going to do it?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will distribute the sheets containing
Situation No. 1 to the members of the class. He will
read the situation aloud, point out the places and locations
referred to and make such explanations as
may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>One or more members of the class will be called
upon to state his understanding of the situation and
this will be continued until it is apparent that all
members of the class understand it and are ready to
proceed with a solution on the same basis of understanding.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going ahead with the problem
I want to say a few words about the importance
of this subject of approach march and deployment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Prior to the war we did not appreciate the necessity
for extensive drill and instruction in the subject
of approach march, deployment and the relief of
units on the firing line. There was little literature
on the subjects and what there was dealt only in glittering
generalities. Once in a while a training program
included the subject ‘Deployment,’ but no one
took it seriously and such as we carried out, were executed
in a purely perfunctory manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the training of troops for modern warfare the
subject must be given the place and attention that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>deserves. Troops must be trained to take up the approach
march formation, and make a deployment
therefrom, both day and night, over all kinds of
ground. They must be trained in the methods and
technique of making a relief of a force on the firing
line at night and overcome the obstacles that are
habitually encountered. The great danger at night
is in losing direction. This results in a command
getting lost and failure to get to the line of departure
ready to ‘Jump off’ at H Hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The failure of a single battalion in this respect
may imperil a whole military operation and cost the
lives of thousands of men. Unless the troops told
off to make the attack are in place ready to ‘jump
off’ and follow the barrage at H Hour there is not
the slightest chance for success. The barrage goes
on. The enemy is given time to man his positions
and machine guns and the attack on that particular
front is held up, usually with enormous losses. The
whole attack has to be reorganized and started anew.
Those of you who have had experience with an attack
which was a failure know how much time is lost and
how many casualties may result from such affairs.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, let us take up the problem as
it concerns our battalion. The battalion command
post we will say is right here where we are standing.
Just how do you visualize the distribution of the battalion,
Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “The battalion headquarters
company would be in this vicinity. Company A
would be the leading company on the right; Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>B would be the leading company on the left;
Company C would be following Company A at a distance
of say 100 yards and Company D would be following
Company B at about the same distance. Each
company would be in two echelons, an assault echelon
of two platoons and a support echelon of one platoon,
the latter following at about 50 yards. The
men have taken advantage of such natural cover that
exists and where there is none they have dug individual
fox holes to get into. These afford a lot of cover
from shrapnel fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You have given a very good picture
of the formation. Are there any questions? If you
do not understand all that is being said, now is the
time to speak out. We must all approach the solution
of the problem on the same basis to get the greatest
benefit from it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will point out to the members of the
class the location of the various elements of the battalion
on the ground and go into the details of the
formation if it is deemed necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The requirement of the problem
involves Major A’s order for the approach march.
Lieutenant Ralston, what must the Major do before
he is ready to issue his orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “He must size up the situation,
arrive at a decision as to what he is going to do
and then put this decision in the form of an order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the first part of his Estimate
of this Situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “He will determine upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>mission. I would say that the immediate mission is
to relieve the 2nd battalion and that the next phase
of it is to prepare to continue the attack tomorrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Very good. What is the next
point he will consider, Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “He must consider the enemy.
The enemy has been retreating before our attack for
the past two days. This shows that he is inferior in
strength and morale. His defense arrangements
must be very much impaired and the confusion that
exists behind his lines may readily be imagined. The
fact that he is doggedly contesting our advance and
that his retreat has nowhere broken down to the extent
that we have been able to break through his lines
with a deep penetration shows that he still has a lot
of fight in him. As soon as it is sufficiently dark to
preclude the possibility of aerial observation the
enemy will begin shifting his defense elements with a
view to preparations to resist our advance again tomorrow.
He will be effecting a relief of his worn-out
troops, shifting his machine guns to more advantageous
positions, changing his artillery so as to more
effectively cover the ground which we will have to
pass over tomorrow if our attack is a success. All
of this will consume several hours. During the
period of readjustment and redistribution of troops
the hostile activity and fire will naturally be very
much diminished. During this same period from
dusk until several hours later these same things will
be happening in our lines, as you can see. Our artillery
will have to be brought up to new positions for
the destructive bombardment and the barrage. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>machine guns have to be placed in position to better
support the riflemen. Our tanks have to be gotten
up ready for the ‘jump off’ tomorrow morning and
our worn-out troops on the front lines have to be
relieved. It will be a period of lessened activity on
both sides. During this period we will take advantage
of the opportunity to effect the relief of the 2nd
battalion on the line.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The terrain over which the approach march and the
relief should now be discussed.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is a very good discussion of
the consideration of the enemy and our troops. Captain
Hodges, what other factors enter into the estimate
of the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Our plans, I should say, the
Major would want to determine on the formation
that he will adopt for the approach march. He wants
to arrive on the front line with his assault elements
in the best possible formation to go into action. It
will be more and more difficult to make changes in the
formation as he approaches the location of the front
lines. He will therefore start his approach march in
as nearly the formation that he wants to be in when
he arrives on the line.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. In making a relief
of this kind you cannot march a battalion up
within the zone of rifle and machine gun fire in a
column of files and then expect to get into combat
formation and effect a relief properly. It simply
cannot be done. You must get into your formation
sufficiently far back to make sure of it and then take
advantage of the various invulnerable formations to
cross dangerous ground to the best advantage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>with a minimum of losses. Now, Captain James,
what would be your decision?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “To march to the front and effect
the relief of the 2nd battalion as soon as possible
after dusk.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Very good. Now all of what we
have said is termed the ‘Estimate of the Situation.’
I hope you all appreciate the necessity for the battalion
commander going through this process of
thought before arriving at his decision and framing
up his order based on it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are now ready to proceed with a discussion of
the Major’s order. Lieutenant Baker, what would
you include in the first paragraph?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “The information of the enemy
and our own troops. This would include information
about the enemy’s retreat all along the line during
the day; of the point reached by the front lines of
our 2nd battalion; of the proposed attack tomorrow
morning; of the fact that the 3rd battalion will relieve
our battalion tonight; of the action to be taken
by the 2nd battalion after we relieve it. This is all
that it would be necessary for the troops to know at
this time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you have covered the essential
points. Captain Hall, what would you include in
the second paragraph of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would state my plan, to the effect
that we are to relieve the 2nd battalion tonight.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the next part of the order,
Lieutenant Barry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “The disposition of the troops
and the orders for each element of the battalion: I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>would want the intelligence section of my headquarters’
company to get to the front at the earliest possible
moment, secure the intelligence ‘dope’ and be
prepared to take over the intelligence functions as
soon as the relief is effected. I would order the section
to proceed up to the C. P. of the 2nd battalion
right away and instruct them to get on the job. I
would also want my communications platoon to get
up to the front and make arrangements to take over
the communication net and the message center of the
2nd battalion. If these outfits get an early start they
will be able to accomplish much before it gets dark.
They should lose no time in getting to the front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, what would you
include in the orders for the companies of the Battalion?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “The Major has decided upon
the formation already. There only remains the task
of putting the decision into an order. I would preserve
the present dispositions of the units and direct:
Company A to march at —— (time), in approach
march formation; designate the sector of the company;
announce the guide (right or left) towards the
base company; give the compass bearing of the direction
of the march and to make sure that contact
will not be lost with the base company will caution
to that effect. I would also include in this part of the
order the fact that Company A is to relieve the Assault
Company of the 2nd battalion which is immediately
in its front. The orders for Company B, which
is to be the other Assault Company, would contain
the same instructions as Company A with the addition
of a sentence giving the Company a directing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>line in addition to the compass bearing of the line of
march.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would include in the orders for Company C the
same line of instructions as for Company A except
that I would tell them the distance they are to follow
Company A and the fact that they are to relieve the
local support company of the 2nd battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Company D’s orders will include the same instructions
contained in these for Company C except
directions for them to relieve the machine gun elements
of the 2nd Battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think these instructions would be all that are
necessary for the four companies of the battalion to
get them started on the march.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You have covered the points very
well. But, there are some instructions that pertain
to all of the units of the battalion. These would be
included in the final sub-paragraph of paragraph 3
of the order. This paragraph is denominated (x)
in the order. What are they, Lieutenant Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I should think they would include:
The designation of the base Company; instructions
for sending a reconnaissance officer and
party of guides forward at once; designating the
place where the leading elements of the battalion are
to halt for the purpose of receiving final orders for
the relief of the units of the 2nd battalion; designation
of the place where unit commanders are to assemble
to receive orders for the relief.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Paragraph 4 of a field order includes
administrative arrangements. Can you think
of anything that would be necessary to be included
in that paragraph of Major A’s orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I can think of nothing. That
would depend upon circumstances. These administrative
arrangements include: instructions for the
trains—which have already been attended to; collecting
station for wounded—which will be announced
in a later order. It may be assumed that as
soon as the advance halted that the rolling kitchen
was brought up and the men given a hot meal before
relieving the 2nd battalion. If such is the case the
kitchen will have to be disposed of in paragraph 4.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What will paragraph 5 contain?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “It will contain information of
the time when the present command post of the battalion
will close and when and where it will next be
opened.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We have now covered the elements
of the Major’s order. Let us review them briefly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 1: Information of the enemy and our
own troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 2: The Major’s plan of action in general
terms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 3: Distribution of troops—orders for
the various elements of the battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 4: Administrative arrangements.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 5: Time of closing the present C. P.
and when and where it will next open.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, I want each member of the class to write
out the battalion commander’s order on his pad.
Base your order on the dispositions that we have discussed
in the solution of the problem; use the 5 paragraph
order system; endeavor to include all the instructions
that we have included in our solution.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the area supposed to
be occupied by Company B. The Director will distribute
the sheets containing Situation No. 2 to the
members of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain B, are commanding Company B.
You have the order of the battalion commander relating
to your company as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>(<i>d</i>) Captain B, with Company B, will march at
—— (hour) p. m., in approach march formation
in the right (left) half of the regimental sector, preparatory
to relieving the right (left) assault company
of the 2nd battalion. Directing line ——
(state directing line). Compass bearing —— degrees,
magnetic.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>x</i>) Company B, base company.</p>

<p class='c010'>A reconnaissance officer from each company, accompanied
by scouts and guides will be sent forward
at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Rolling kitchens will join the combat train of
the reserve battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have returned to your Company.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will read the situation aloud, make
such explanations as may be necessary and point out
the area occupied by Company B. One or more
members of the class may be called upon to state his
understanding of the situation.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what do you
understand to be the formation of Company B at
this moment?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would say that the company
would be in approach march formation. There
would be two platoons, let us say the 1st and 2nd, in
the assault echelon and one, the 3rd, in the support
echelon. All three of the platoons would at this time
be deployed in two waves, a section of three squads
in each wave. I think each section would be deployed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>in a line of skirmishers while at a halt. The
company headquarters would be here, about midway
between the assault echelon and the support echelon.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Lieutenant Williams will point out the location of
the various elements of the Company on the ground.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Why do you think the Company
would be deployed in a line of skirmishers at this
time?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “When the company halts
the men will want to take advantage of existing
cover. If there is little cover available, as in this
case, each man will dig himself in—he will dig a ‘fox
hole’ big enough to give him some cover. Shell holes
will be improved along their forward lips to give
cover and if large ones are available as much as a
half squad may occupy one of them. Another reason
for the support battalion deploying into a line of
skirmishers when it halts for any length is this: If
the enemy should make a counter-attack and break
through our assault battalion, and the companies of
our support battalion are ‘dug in’ in a line of skirmishers
they are in position to meet him without any
change in the formation. Everything is all set and
ready to receive the counter-attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you have sized up the formation
pretty well. I think if any member of this
class is ever in command of an assault company of a
support battalion in action he will remember this
phase of this Terrain Exercise and when he halts for
any length of time he will get the company into a line
of skirmishers and have them dig in. You may say
‘why dig in for such a short halt.’ I answer that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>will have no trouble getting the men to dig fox holes
after they have been in action a few times. They
soon learn the value of them and automatically
do it.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, let us assume
that you are Captain B. How do you size up the
situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “My immediate mission is to
get my company ready to march at the appointed
hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have little information of the detailed dispositions
of the enemy that is opposing our 1st battalion
but my reconnaissance officer whom I will send forward
right away will secure it and have it available
for me before the orders for the actual relief are to
be issued.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are to relieve the right (left) assault company
of the 1st battalion which is now in close contact
with the enemy along the front lines. Due to
casualties and the progress of the day’s action it is
probable that each of his assault platoons have both
waves in the firing line and it is highly probable that
some or all of the support platoon has also been absorbed
in the firing line. It is necessary for Company
B in making the relief to get the assault troops
in the proper formation to make the attack tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The present formation of the company is suitable
for the purpose and will need no change. We can
march straight to the front in our present general
formation. We will change from a line of skirmishers
into a line of squad columns for each of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>waves of the 1st and 2nd platoons and the 3rd platoon
will march in a column of section columns with
the second section staggered to the right of the first.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Discuss features of the terrain as they actually exist.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Your decision will be to march to
the front in the general formation you are now in.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now let us go into details a little.
Lieutenant Wallace, what do you understand to be
the purpose of the ‘Directing line’ assigned to the
company by the Major?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “The directing line was assigned
in addition to the compass bearing to make
doubly sure that the company would keep the right
direction and that there would be little chance for
getting lost. It is a well defined topographical feature
and will serve the purpose very well.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You note that the company has
been designated as ‘base company.’ What do you
understand by that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “It is the company on which
all the units of the battalion will guide during the
approach march.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “This places an additional responsibility
on the company. If Company B loses its direction
the whole battalion will do the same and it is
probable that the troops will not be in position ready
to ‘jump off’ tomorrow morning. You have no idea
of the confusion that can take place in an outfit that
loses its direction and gets lost in an operation of this
kind. Every possible precaution must be taken to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>prevent it. In this case the Captain must charge the
platoon that is to march nearest to the directing line
to guide on that line throughout the march and for
the other platoons to guide on it. In this case the
right (left) assault platoon will be designated ‘base
platoon’ and will take every precaution to keep the
right (left) element of the platoon absolutely on the
directing line. You can see that this places the responsibility
for the march direction of the whole
battalion on the squad that is nearest the directing
line. I want you to keep this in mind throughout the
problem.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, what preliminary
arrangements would Captain B make for issuing
his orders to the company?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “The company command
post is supposed to be located here.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—In framing up the problem the Director should locate
the Company C. P. where there is cover. If it is impracticable
to do so, it may be assumed that there is a shell hole
available.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Captain will assemble the platoon commanders
and platoon sergeants and issue the orders
for the initial operation of the Company.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What will be included in the first
paragraph of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “The information of the
enemy and our own troops. This will be a repetition
of paragraph 1 of the Major’s order with the addition
of information as to what the other companies
of the battalion are going to do. Captain B will go
into details, for it must be remembered, that none of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the platoon commanders were present when Major
A issued his orders and they know nothing of the
situation except what they have been able to observe
for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I am glad to hear you bring out
that point. It takes only a few minutes to explain
the situation in detail and is most valuable to subordinate
officers who are charged with the task of actually
carrying out the operations. They must know
the details of the situation. Now, Captain Harvey,
what would you include in the second paragraph of
the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “My plans. To march at the
designated hour, preparatory to relieving the right
(left) assault company of the 1st battalion. In order
to save questions regarding the relief I would state
to the effect that detailed instructions would be issued
later.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Very good. Now comes the distribution
of troops. That is paragraph 3 of the field
order. What points would you include in it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would give the orders for each
platoon separately. Those for the right assault platoon
would come first. I would designate the platoon
by number and the name of the platoon commander;
state the formation; the sector that the platoon is to
march in; announce the guide; and the compass bearing
of the march. In the case of the base platoon I
would indicate the directing line of the march in
addition.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will then follow with instructions for the reconnaissance
party and guides to go to the front right
away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Then will come that part of the order that is of
interest to all the elements of the Company. The
announcement of the base platoon; where the halt is
to be made to receive detailed orders for the relief.
Then will follow the final paragraph of the order
designating the place where the Company Headquarters
is to march.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you have covered the elements
of the company order very well. I hope all of
you see the necessity for such an order. You may
say: why all of this long-winded order for the operation
of a single rifle company? Why not have Captain
B simply give the signal for the advance when
the time comes and have the company go ahead?
Suppose you were one of the platoon commanders in
the company, would you rather have the detailed
order for your operation or would you be more satisfied
with a mere extended order drill formation? I
am sure you will all favor the order procedure and
that is the answer to the question. If every man has
information of what is going on and he knows the
part that his unit is to take in the operation he can
go about his work in a much more intelligent manner.
I am pleased to note that many of you are taking
notes on the technique of the Captain’s order. They
will now stand you in good stead. Are there any
questions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I note that Captain Harvey
made a statement about sending forward the reconnaissance
party. Who would head that party and
just what would it be composed of?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what are your
ideas about this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would have the second in command
lead the party. It would be composed of two
runners from each of the platoons and two from
company headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You cannot have the second in
command lead the party. He is not up with the company
at this time. He is back with the rear echelon
of the company. The idea is that he will remain
there so as to be available to take charge in case the
company commander becomes a casualty.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “That is right. I had overlooked
that fact. I would have the commander of the 3rd
platoon conduct the reconnaissance party. His platoon
is to be in support and is the most available officer.
The platoon sergeant can conduct the platoon
on the approach march.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. Does that
answer your question, Captain Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to write out Captain B’s order on his pad.
Place yourself in the Captain’s shoes; visualize the
situation just as it is before you; refer to the notes
you have made during the solution and explanations;
and write out the order. This is the very best training
you can possibly get. It puts the proposition
right up to you for solution. In writing the order
leave a margin of 1½ inches on the left.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the class has finished with the order the Director
will direct each member to pass his order to
the member at his left. Each officer will then correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the order in his possession and make comments on
the margin.</p>

<p class='c010'>When this has been completed the Director will
distribute the mimeograph sheets containing the
order of Captain B and the members of the class will
be allowed a few minutes to compare the order he
has written with the one distributed by the Director.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now I want each member of the
class to write his name at the top of the order he has
prepared and to place the name of the officer who
commented on it at the top of the left-hand margin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When this is done the orders will be collected. The
Director will examine them at his leisure for the purpose
of determining the quality of the work that the
class is doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain B’s order distributed by the Director will
be as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>1. The enemy continued his retreat during the day. Our
2nd battalion has halted along (<i>d</i>)<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c026'><sup>[4]</sup></a> where it is in close
contact with the enemy. Details of location of units
will be given later. The attack will be continued tomorrow
morning. The 3rd battalion relieves our battalion
before ——<a href='#f4' class='c026'><sup>[4]</sup></a> tonight. When relieved the 2nd battalion
goes to the regimental reserve. Our battalion relieves
the 2nd battalion tonight. Company A marches
on our left (right); Company C follows Company A at
a distance of 300 yards; Company D follows us at a
distance of 300 yards.</p>

<p class='c024'>2. This company, as base company of the battalion, will
march at ______ (hour), preparatory to relieving the

<p class='c025'>(<i>d</i>) Lieutenant Z with 8 runners (2 from Company
Headquarters and 2 from each platoon) will proceed
at once to the front, reconnoiter the sector occupied

they may act as guides for the elements of the company
in effecting the relief.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the area over which
the 2nd platoon is to advance.</p>

<p class='c010'>On arriving at a selected point the class will be
halted.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain James, we are now in the
area over which the 2nd platoon is advancing to the
front. Lieutenant Y, the platoon commander, is at
this point. What do you estimate to be the approach
march formation of the platoon?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I will first locate the platoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>commander and then designate the location of the
elements of the platoon with reference to him. I
think that the platoon commander would be marching
at this time about midway between the assault
and the support waves. The 1st Section would be
marching in a line of squad columns with the right
(left) squad near the directing line which is right
there (indicating). It is the base section and the
squad nearest the directing line is the base squad.
The head of the squad columns is about 25 yards in
advance of the platoon commander.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The 2nd platoon is following the platoon commander
at a distance of about 25 yards in a line of
squad columns.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “It seems to me that the platoon
commander would be out in front of his platoon
at this time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The platoon commander is free to
go wherever he pleases. But you must remember he
has two section leaders—one for each section of the
platoon. These men are supposed to be competent
to do their job. The platoon commander should
march where he can best direct the operations of his
platoon through his section leaders. In this case I
think Captain James has located the platoon leader
in the proper place.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now having definitely fixed in our minds the location
of the elements of the platoon let us proceed
with the next situation.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 3</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You., Lieutenant Y., commanding the 2nd platoon
have arrived at this point (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The 1st section is in a line of squad columns 25
yards to the front; the 2nd section is in a line of
squad columns 25 yards in rear of you. For some
minutes enemy shells have been falling in the area
which is occupied by one of our batteries at the rate
of about 4 per minute. At this moment the fire increased
materially. The men have left the guns temporarily.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes the sheets containing
Situation No. 3 and points out to the class the extent
of the shelled area. It should be in the direct line
of march of the 2nd platoon.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, how do you size up
the immediate situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “Our original mission has not
changed. We must continue the march to the front
regardless of what the enemy does. The 2nd battalion
must be relieved tonight and our battalion
must make the relief. We cannot stand here and
wait for the enemy’s fire to let up. It is obvious that
we cannot go through the shelled area without ruinous
losses. The only thing left for us to do is to go
around it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Those are the points I wanted to
bring out. The question before us is: How are we
going to get around the shelled area? What have
you to suggest, Lieutenant Barry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “In the first place I will have
to decide the question as to which side of the shelled
area we are to use in getting around it. If the whole
platoon goes around one side and the enemy fire shifts
in that direction we may get caught in it and lose a
lot of men. I think we would reduce our chances of
loss by using both sides and having one platoon go
around to the right and one to the left.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, what do you
think of that proposition?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I think it is all right. The
question that arises in my mind is that of loss of control
by the platoon commander and the difficulties of
getting into the proper formation on the other side
of the shelled area again.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “When you consider that the platoon
commander has a team of two sections each
under the charge of a competent leader the difficulties
are really not so great as they would at first appear.
Let us decide that we are to go around the
shelled area on both sides of it, a section on each side.
On which side will you have the leading section go,
Lieutenant Williams?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “The 1st Section is the base
section of the platoon—as such it is the base element
of the company and the whole battalion. It is the
unit on which the whole battalion is guiding its
march. It should therefore go around on the ——
side so that the 1st platoon can keep in touch with it
and guide on it. When it gets to the other side of
the shelled area it can deploy and get its —— element
on the directing line again. By employing
this method there will be no chance for the 1st platoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>losing connection with it. The 2nd section
will go around to the ——.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think your reasoning is logical
and if there are no objections we will accept that
method. Now the battery commander of the battery
being shelled will want to know what is going on.
Captain Hastings, how will you provide for this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I will send a runner to him
with a message giving him the necessary information.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us assume that we have arrived
at the decision indicated in our discussion. How
would you get the orders to the troops?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “When we get up as far as it
is safe to go I will signal the platoon to halt. And
then call for the section leaders to report to me.
When they get here I will give them the orders
necessary for the execution of the maneuver.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Class is now conducted forward to the point
where it is as far as it is safe to go and still avoid
casualties from the enemy shell fire.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “It is considered that this is as far
forward as it is reasonably safe to go. Lieutenant Y
has halted the platoon and the section leaders have
reported to him for orders. Now I want each member
of the class to consider himself being Lieutenant
Y and to write out on your pads the exact words that
Lieutenant Y will say to the section leaders. Then
follow this with the contents of the verbal message
that you will send by runner to the battery commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The necessary time is allowed for this. When the
solutions are completed the Director will have one or
more members of the class read aloud what they have
written. The solutions are discussed and commented
upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will then distribute to the class the
mimeograph slips containing the orders of Lieutenant
Y and a few minutes are allowed for the members
of the class to compare them with their work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The order of Lieutenant Y will be as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The enemy is shelling the battery in our immediate
front. There is no further information of our own
troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This platoon will go around the shelled area.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 1st section will go around to the —— (right)
(left) side towards the rest of the battalion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 2nd section will go around to the —— (left)
(right) side towards the directing line.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On arriving at the other side of the shelled area the
platoon will again take up the same formation that it is
in now.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will go in rear of the 1st platoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The following message will be sent to the battery
commander:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Second Platoon Company B —— Infantry is going
around your battery position to the right and left. Will
deploy again on the other side of the shelled area.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Class will now be conducted up to the place
where the company commanders have been ordered
to meet the battalion commander to receive orders
for the relief of the 2nd battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “This is the place where Major A
directed the Company Commanders to rendezvous to
receive the final orders for the relief of the 1st battalion.
We assume that the troops have been halted
along the line —— (indicate) where they have
taken advantage of such cover as is available and are
preparing individual cover where none is available.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will now distribute the sheets containing
Situation No. 4.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Major A, have arrived at this point. You
have had a conference with the commander of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>2nd battalion, made a reconnaissance of the position
and determined the location of the units to be relieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The latter are as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Company E occupies the right half of the sector
with all three platoons on the firing line.</p>

<p class='c010'>Company F occupies the left half of the sector
with two platoons and a part of the third in the
firing line and the remainder of the third as local
support.</p>

<p class='c010'>Company C is located in fox holes at —— (indicate
the location) as battalion reserve. A part of
the company has participated in the day’s action but
the men are all now at the location indicated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Company D has one platoon divided among the
assault companies, and the company (less this platoon)
is with the battalion reserve with guns located
to cover approaches and to execute overhead harassing
fire on enemy back areas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Detachments of the Howitzer Company are in
position in the platoon sectors and are to remain with
the 1st battalion for tomorrow’s attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battalion headquarters company has taken
over the intelligence duties, the communications net
and the message center.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is now —— o’clock p. m.</p>

<p class='c010'>The enemy occupies the —— (give general location
of front lines).</p>

<p class='c010'>There is considerable shelling throughout the area
and occasional bursts of machine gun and rifle fire
along the entire battle front.</p>

<p class='c010'>Your company commanders are assembled here in
accordance with the instructions contained in your
last order.</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Your orders and instructions.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will read the situation aloud, make
such explanations as may be necessary and point out
the places mentioned. One or more members of the
class will be called upon to state their understanding
of the tactical situation at this time.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, we have now
to consider the orders and instructions that Major
A would issue to his assembled Company commanders.
What is the first thing you would put into the
Major’s order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “The Major has been out to
the front and made a personal reconnaissance as far
as practicable. He has interviewed the Commander
of the 2nd battalion and the officers of his staff who
have detailed information as to the situation. He
ought to have pretty definite information of just
how the different elements of the 2nd battalion are
disposed. He should give his Company Commanders
all of this information in the first paragraph of
the order. We note that this information is all contained
in Situation No. 3.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would you include in the
next paragraph of the order, Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “My plan, to the effect that
our battalion is to relieve the 2nd battalion.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “But we are going to do more
than that. We are going to make the attack tomorrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>morning. It seems to me that the Major would
include in the order all the instructions he wants to
give the Company Commanders not only for the relief,
but for the attack also. What do you think
about that, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The Major would certainly not let
his Company Commanders get away without giving
them all the instructions possible regarding the part
they are to play in the attack tomorrow morning.
But there are several things that he must get from
higher up before he can complete his plans for the
attack and give them to his Company Commanders.
He must know the time the attack is to begin. He
must know about the artillery preparation and the
rate of advance of the rolling barrage. He must
have information regarding the cooperation of the
tanks. While he is waiting for this information,
which he momentarily expects, he will go ahead and
issue his orders for the relief. Then if the other essential
information is not at hand by the time the
Company Commanders must join their companies, he
will issue as much of the attack order as possible and
leave the rest to go out later. He certainly will not
let his Captains get away until they have all the instructions
it is possible to give them up to the time it
is necessary for them to leave—the arrangements to
continue the attack tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Those are the points I wanted
to know about.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Captain Hodges, what is the
next part of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “The tactical dispositions. Orders
for each element of the battalion. Designate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>relieving unit and the unit to be relieved. For example:
‘Company A will relieve Company E.’ This
same form will pertain with all the elements of the
battalion.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Just how much detail would you
include? To what extent would you go in prescribing
the formation of the company when the relief
is completed? For instance: Company E has all
three platoons in the assault echelon at this time.
Would you want Company A to do the same and hold
out no company supports?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Now, that is quite a point. I
had not thought of it. I might assume that Captain
A would take up the proper formation without my
specifying it, but to make sure I believe I would add
another sentence or two and specify the formation.
I should say he ought to have two platoons in the
assault echelon and one held out as local support. I
think it would be better to specify that. There
would be less chance for a misunderstanding. I
would also give these same instructions to the Captain
of Company B.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. It will certainly
do no harm. In any event you have no doubt
as to what you want done. Now, what about the
machine gun company, Captain James? You will
note that there is only one platoon up on the lines
now. The rest of the company is back with the reserve
with their guns covering the approaches and set
up for overhead fire on back areas. Do you want to
leave them that way?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “No, sir. I think I would need
the supporting fire of all the machine guns in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>‘jump off’ tomorrow morning. I would assign one
platoon to support Company A and the company
(less 1 platoon) to support Company B. I think
that would be better. If the attack goes over with a
good gain in ground tomorrow morning the machine
guns will not be able to keep up with it, and the Major
will have an opportunity to make an adjustment of
their position in the battalion. I certainly would
want the advantage of their fire in the ‘jump off.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. Let us decide
on that disposition.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, there is another point I want
to bring out at this time. You have pictured in your
own mind this formation and advance of one battalion
of Infantry and the relief and retirement of
another. Along side of you to the right are two other
battalions going through the same process. The
same is happening to your left and all along the line.
Behind you there are other battalions effecting reliefs.
There are batteries of artillery and transport
vehicles, innumerable. In other words the back area
of a force in action is crowded with troops. There
is much activity effecting reliefs, getting up supplies
and ammunition and evacuating the wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The enemy is doing these same things. His
back areas are just as crowded as our own. He is
no better off than we are in this respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is our job to interfere with him as much as possible—to
prevent or curtail movement, and inflict
losses on him. The wounding or killing of one man
by harassing fire will have no effect on the outcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of the war, but if we can kill and wound a thousand
every night it will in time have its effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The enemy can get away from artillery fire by
avoiding shelled areas but he cannot get away from
rifle and machine gun harassing fire for he never
knows when and where it is going to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If there is sufficient small arms ammunition
available and it can be gotten up to the riflemen and
machine gunners on the front lines the back areas
of the enemy can be made a perfect ‘hell-hole’ by
means of systematic harassing fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Many of the men whom our men will relieve tonight
will have ammunition in bandoliers with them.
By having our men take over this ammunition and
expending it tonight we can get a big increase in fire
over the enemy back areas. Our ammunition supply
for tomorrow will not be impaired. The men being
relieved will be re-supplied when they get back to
the regimental reserve. I think arrangements should
be made for this procedure by the Major.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The Major has made arrangements
with the Commanding Officer 2nd battalion as to
when the command of the sector is to pass to the 1st
battalion. He will now have to tell his company
commanders when their full responsibility is to devolve
upon them for their respective sectors within
the battalion. What would you do about that, Lieutenant
Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “When a relief is made in larger
commands the orders state the hour when the
command is to pass to the relieving troops. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>a case like this I judge that it passes when the relief
is completed. In order to make sure that the point
is understood I would specify:</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Command of company sectors will pass when
reliefs have been completed.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that would be a good idea.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “There is another point that
should be included in the order. Let us say I am
Captain B. My company is relieving Company F
on the lines. The Captain of Company F either has
not received definite orders as to what he is to do on
being relieved or has overlooked the instructions in
the confusion. It seems to me that it might be well
for the Major to tell us just what Major B’s instructions
are as to that point. It might save a lot of
confusion in getting the 2nd battalion troops disengaged
and out of the battalion sector. It might save
a lot of casualties from men wandering around in the
darkness for my section and squad leaders to be able
to tell the men they are relieving just where to go.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I do not know that such instructions
have a place in the regular order form. But
I see no objection to putting it in. It can do no harm
I am sure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, the Major will want to know when the reliefs
have been completed and he will give instructions
to that effect. He will then announce the location
of the battalion command post and this will
complete the details of the order.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, I want each member of the class to write
out Major A’s orders for the relief of the 2nd battalion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The necessary time is allowed for this. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>completed the Director will call upon one or more of
the members of the class to read his orders aloud and
comments are invited from other members of the
class.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will then distribute the mimeograph
sheets containing the Major’s order and an opportunity
will be given the members of the class to compare
the work with the solution presented.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Major’s order will be as follows:</p>

in bandoliers, which will be expended to keep up
harassing fire during the remainder of the night, with a
view to curtailing movement within the enemy lines.
Company D will take over surplus ammunition from
Company H and expend it for the same purpose. The
regular ammunition supply will be reserved for the action
tomorrow.</p>

<p class='c010'>What orders do you give?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will distribute the sheets containing
Situation No. 5, read the situation aloud and explain
the message from the regimental commander. One
or more members of the class will be called upon to
state his understanding of the situation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us visualize the situation. The
Major has been expecting to receive just such a message
from the regimental commander. As a matter
of fact he anticipated it when he made the estimate of
the situation before issuing his first order for the approach
march before dark. He ordered his formation
for the approach march so that when the order
for the attack came there would be few changes
necessary. By his foresight and knowledge of infantry
tactics he now has his battalion in the proper
formation to make the relief of the 2nd battalion and
when this is accomplished he will have his units properly
disposed to make the attack tomorrow morning.
In other words, the Major started his attack when he
made his initial dispositions. And this must be so in
every case. When you get into the infantry area of
a battle you must get your troops into a formation
from which they can make an attack or repel an
enemy counter-attack and you must keep them in that
formation. That is why the subject of approach
march and deployment is so important and that is
why troops must be so thoroughly trained in it. During
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the war the subject was given little attention in
our divisions. The British and French instructors
brought nothing of it over from the other side. They
had communication trenches as lanes of approach
and gave little heed to the open warfare end of the
game. The American divisions soon realized the
necessity for thorough training and the most successful
ones were those that spent many of their
nights with units from battalions to brigades chasing
through the woods, up hill and down dale, practicing
the approach march formation. I am sure that when
you consider the proposition seriously and visualize
what can happen in a situation such as we have had
to do with today you will realize the necessity for
thorough training in the subject.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now let us consider what must be
included in the Major’s order for the attack. Captain
Hall, what have you to suggest for the first paragraph?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The Major has already given the
company commanders everything he knows about the
enemy. He has a little additional information to the
effect that the general attack all along the line will be
resumed tomorrow. This will be included in the first
paragraph of the order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is all that is necessary.
Our second paragraph is a much more complicated
affair. What have you to suggest to go into it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The first thing would be the time
of the attack. The orders from regimental headquarters
say 5.00 o’clock. That will be included in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the order. We have a definite mission for the battalion.
To pierce the enemy position and assist our
division to penetrate the position—that is, to make a
break through, if possible. In order to do this we
have got to drive hard. There is no change in the
zone of action of the battalion; it remains the same
as it was for today. The line of departure should be
given. The information about the artillery preparation
and the rolling barrage should be included. I
think that is about all that must go into paragraph
two of the order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes. But you have skimped over
two very important points without the explanation
they deserve. These are the line of departure and
the information about the artillery preparation and
the rolling barrage. Let us go into these things a
little more in detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The division staff has made arrangements for the
artillery preparation to come down along a certain
line, and stand there for a period of thirty minutes.
Then the barrage will begin to advance at exactly
5.00 o’clock. Unless we have a definite line of departure
some parts of our front line may work their
way to the front and be caught under our own barrage
and you can see what would happen. In case
any men do work forward during the night on reconnaissance
they must get back a little before 4.30 so
as not to get caught under the barrage.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I appreciate all the Director
has said. But we have to keep up a reconnaissance
during the night to keep in contact with the enemy.
He might pull his lines back during the night and if
he had decided to make a general retreat we would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>lose touch and with it a lot of time in conducting the
pursuit. I think some of our patrols would have to
take a chance on getting back so as not to lose contact.
Then, too, if the enemy had pretty definite information
that our artillery preparation is coming
down on a certain line and we have no men out in
front he may move his machine gun squads a little
to the front and avoid the barrage altogether and be
ready to receive our attack when our first wave goes
over the top. If I were commanding one of those
assault companies I would keep my front thoroughly
patrolled during the night and keep my scouts right
up in the enemy’s lines until a minute or two before
the barrage comes down. I would have them beat it
back a hundred yards and take a chance on escaping
from the barrage. As soon as they are out of the way
I would then have my special weapons and riflemen
keep up a fire on any enemy troops that showed
themselves trying to get to a position in front of
where the barrage is coming down.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “That is all very interesting. Those
are important points that we must not lose sight of
in our operations against an active and crafty enemy.
He will pull all kinds of stunts on you and you have
to be just a lap ahead of him to best him. All of this
shows the great necessity for combat training. We
must have patrol leaders and scouts that know the
importance of all these things and know how to go
about them. We hear so much about the technical
branches and the high order of training that is required.
If there is any training more difficult than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that of the ‘doughboy’ I have yet to see it. Take the
training of patrol leaders and scouts for the single
phase of infantry combat that we have just been discussing.
I leave it to you if there is anything more
technical and difficult in the training of soldiers. If
these men fail the whole military operation falls
down and may be an utter failure. A half dozen machine
guns on a battalion front that have moved forward
a few yards and escaped the barrage will be
able to hold up a whole battalion. So let us not
neglect the training of our scouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the enemy should fall back during the night
our scouts will follow him up and keep in touch with
him, word will go back to the battalion and on back
to the division so that arrangements can be made to
alter the plans. In that case the battalion commander
will order a general advance to keep in
contact.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, what would you
include in paragraph 3 of the Major’s order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “The detail orders for each element
of the battalion, giving the designation of the
organization and the particular part that it is to play
in the operation. There will be orders for Company
A, the right assault company; Company B, the left
assault company; Company C, the battalion reserve,
and Company D, the machine gun company. Then
the orders for the elements of the Howitzer Company
hold off to support the attack. I believe that would
complete paragraph 3 of the order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would you include in paragraph
4, Lieutenant Williams?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would include the location
of the station for slightly wounded. I do not
know of anything else.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “And paragraph 5 would contain
what?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “The location of the regimental
and battalion command posts.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we have discussed everything
that must be included in the battalion order.
If you will compare all of this with some of the battalion
orders you, as Company Commanders, received
in France, you will see how sadly lacking some
of them were. What we want to do is to prevent a
repetition of those conditions and that is why we are
devoting our time and attention to these things now.
We want to be prepared to solve these problems if
the time ever comes when we have to do so again.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the

</div>
<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>Special Situation—Blue</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The Blue forces, after severe fighting, have
reached the line (<i>a</i>). The reds have vigorously defended
every foot of the ground, and it is apparent
that the resistance is growing stronger.</p>

<p class='c010'>On account of the exhausted condition of the
troops and the lack of fresh reserves, the Blues are
unable to continue the advance and it has been decided
to assume the defensive, temporarily.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 2nd battalion, which has been the assault battalion,
has been stopped and is now holding the line
(<i>b-c</i>). It has suffered heavy casualties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 1st battalion, which has been in regimental
support, has had comparatively few casualties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 3rd battalion is the regimental reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is now 4.30 p. m.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been decided to have the 1st battalion, with
one platoon of the howitzer company attached, organize
and hold a defensive position covering the
front of the regimental sector just in rear of the
line now occupied by the 2nd battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Major A, the battalion commander, accompanied
by his company commanders and Lieutenant Z, commanding
the howitzer platoon, has made a personal
reconnaissance of the position and issued the following
verbal orders to the assembled officers:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“The enemy has stopped our advance temporarily. It
is necessary for us to assume the defensive until our troops
can be reorganized and arrangements made to resume the
advance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our 2nd battalion is now holding the line (<i>b-c</i>). It
will withdraw after dark. Our 3rd battalion relieves us
as support battalion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The —— infantry on our right will hold the front
from (<i>d</i> to <i>e</i>); the —— infantry on our left will hold the
front from (<i>f</i> to <i>g</i>).</p>

work on the part of the Director in order to get all of
the features of the position worked out in detail so as to be able
to include them in the order to the company commanders. If
it is practicable to do so the boundaries of the battalion sector,
together with the location of the machine guns and howitzer
units and the battalion C. P., should be marked with flags.
This will save many questions during the Terrain Exercise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>save a lot of time. It will give the members of the class a
much better idea of the set-up and they will be able to proceed
with the solution of their part of the problem more readily.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are assembled in the vicinity
of (<i>x</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the sheets containing the
special situation Blue and reads it aloud. The members
of the class follow from the copy in their possession.
The places, localities and areas referred to
are pointed out in detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will call upon one or more members
of the class to state his understanding of the tactical
situation and this process is continued until he
is satisfied that all members know the details and are
ready to proceed with the solution.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going further with the
problem I want to make some remarks on the general
subject of the defensive and some with reference
to the part that the battalion and its component parts
plays in it. The problem under consideration is that
of a passive defense. Our troops have made such
rapid progress that the rear echelons have not been
able to keep up. The enemy has been falling back on
his reserves and naturally his defense is stiffening
all along the line. The time has arrived when it is
necessary for us to stop for a period; reorganize our
forces, which have been more or less disorganized by
our successes; bring up our rear echelons; and prepare
to continue the advance. During this period we
must so organize our position that the enemy will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>have little chance for success should he decide to attack
with a view to interfering with our arrangements.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our attacking troops have now arrived on a general
line where a defensive position may be taken up
and the high command has ordered such action. We
do not want to give up any ground that has been
gained that is suitable for our purpose. Having this
principle in mind Major A has decided to organize
and hold the ground that is now occupied by the support
echelon of the 2nd Battalion.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what factors
exercise the greatest influence in the selection of a
defensive position?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I should say the facilities
for communication and those for observation. The
greater ease with which we can move troops within
the position the better we can defend it, and unless
we have facilities for observation we had better move
to another place for the enemy will be able to surprise
us on any and all occasions.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “In a defensive position we deploy
in great depth. What is the object of this, Captain
Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Where a great mass of enemy
artillery is to be encountered we must disperse our
troops over a large area to force him to scatter his
fire, and waste a lot of it. In addition to this we
must have room to maneuver our counter-attack units
and get them into action with as little flank marching
as possible. In a case like we are considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>here I do not believe such great depth is necessary.
This is open warfare and it will take the enemy quite
a while to get his artillery in shape to employ it effectively
on our position. We will therefore be able
to concentrate our troops in a more shallow zone than
is usual in regular position warfare.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, what are the
defensive areas called in a defensive position?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “They are combat groups;
strong points; centers of resistance; subsectors and
sectors.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What do you understand a combat
group to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “It is an area prepared for
defense and held by a small unit such as a platoon or
section.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is a strong point, Lieutenant
Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “A strong point is an aggregate
of combat groups distributed in width and
depth under the command of one officer. It is
usually defended by a rifle company and usually has
machine guns attached. Where practicable, it is arranged
for all ’round defense.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is a center of resistance?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “An aggregate of strong
points distributed in width and depth and commanded
by one officer. It is usually occupied by a
battalion.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I hope you all see how this proposition
works out. A combat group is the smallest element.
Two or more of these groups form a strong
point. Two or more strong points linked up together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>form a center of resistance. You will note the
Major’s disposition for our battalion here. It forms
a center of resistance consisting of the two strong
points held by Companies A and B respectively with
Company C as a reserve with Company D distributed
at key points within the area.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is now conducted to area (<i>u</i>), which has
been assigned to Company A.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain A, are commanding Company A, the
unit assigned to occupy the area (<i>u</i>) in the right
(left) of the battalion sector. You have Major A’s
order to proceed with your task with the least practicable
delay.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will distribute the sheets containing
Situation No. 1. He will read it to the class and
make such explanation as may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what steps do you
take to get your company up to the front?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I have with me one runner from
each of my platoons and two runners from Company
Headquarters. I will send the platoon runners
back with a verbal message to their respective platoon
commanders to bring the platoons up. I will have
one of my company runners to go to the (indicate
place) with a message to platoon commanders to
halt their platoons there and report to me here. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>think that is all that would be necessary to get the
platoons up and assemble the platoon commanders
here to receive orders.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. We will assume that
you have sent the platoon runners back for the platoons
and that one of your company runners has gone
back to the rendezvous point. What are you going
to do between now and the time the platoon commanders
report to you for orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I am going to make a personal
reconnaissance of the area assigned to my company,
size up the situation, arrive at a decision as to how I
am going to occupy the area and dope out my orders
for the platoon commanders.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is the proper procedure.
Captain Hodges, in what ways may the company be
distributed in an area of this kind?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “In the first place there are three
lines included in the area. The first is the local security
or line of observation—the outpost line; next
is the firing line which is the line of defense of the
area—where the fight will take place if the enemy
attacks; next is the support line. The company must
cover all three of these lines. There are several
methods of deployment available. The company may
be deployed with two platoons each covering the outpost
line and firing line and one platoon on the support
line. In this case each platoon furnishes the
outguards covering its own front. The company may
be deployed with two platoons on the firing line only
and one platoon on the support line; in this case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>outguards would be furnished by the support platoon.
The company may be deployed with one platoon
on the outpost line; one on the firing line and
one on the support line. Again it may be deployed
with the platoons side by side each platoon covering
all three of the lines. In this case each platoon furnished
the outguards covering its own front.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director will draw these four formations out on
the ground and explain them to the class.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Considering the four methods of
deployment which one would you employ in the organization
of this area, Captain James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would favor the first method
where we have two platoons covering the outpost line
and firing line and one platoon on the support line.
Each platoon to furnish the outguards covering its
own front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What factors lead you to favor this
deployment?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “By deploying in this manner
we have two complete combat groups each responsible
for its own outguards and its firing line. We
have a third combat group on the support line located
in the interval between the two forward groups so
that it is readily available for counter-attack in case
the enemy should penetrate the line on our front.
Unity of command is preserved and there will be
little intermingling of men of different units. Each
platoon commander has a definite problem to solve.
I think it is by far the best method.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you see any objections to the
second method of deployment, Lieutenant Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I should say that it is about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the same as the first method. The thing that I do not
like about it is the proposition of taking the outguards
from the support platoon. I like the idea of
having each combat group being responsible for its
whole front. In addition to dividing responsibility
for the defense of the area occupied it weakens the
support platoon and makes it just that much less
effective for counter-attack work.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What objections have you to the
third method—the platoons in echelon one behind the
other?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “When the outguards fall back
on the firing line you have the proposition of an intermingling
of men of the two platoons. That will
cause endless confusion and destroy the unity of
command.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Any objections to the fourth
method?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I can conceive of circumstances
where this method might be employed to advantage.
For example: In woods or in rough, difficult
terrain. I do not think it would be employed in
an area such as we now have under consideration.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We seem to be pretty well agreed
that the first method should be employed. Now what
considerations will affect your decision as to the area
to be included in each of the two combat groups,
Captain Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The battalion commander has assigned
the elements of the machine gun company to
certain positions to cover the front. I would build
my combat groups around this distribution and take
advantage of the fire that they are able to produce.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, where would
you locate the Company C. P.?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “The C. P. should be in such a
position that it can be easily reached and found by
the runners. It should be so arranged that the enemy
will not be able to observe the runners entering and
leaving. I would say that it should be located in the
area lying between the combat groups and the support
platoon.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The Major indicated the firing line
and support line of the battalion center of resistance
and designated the area for Company A to organize
and hold. We have decided to organize it with two
platoons on the firing line, each furnishing its own
outguards and each forming a combat group; and one
platoon on the support line. The 1st battalion advanced
posts are holding the enemy back and there
is every reason to expect that they will be able to
continue to do so for sometime yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The location of the machine guns, the 37 mm. guns
and the light mortars in the area are known.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be necessary for Captain E to assign the
platoons, two to the firing line and one to the support
line, and give necessary instructions regarding the
work to be undertaken. These instructions will not
go into any more detail than is absolutely necessary.
In any event they must not be such as will take the
initiative away from the platoon commanders. The
platoons are given their missions. It is then up to
the platoon commander to execute them. This initial
order is intended merely to get the work started. It
must give the platoon commanders sufficient detail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>for them to go about their reconnaissance and plan
for the organization of their combat groups and the
defensive preparation of the ground they are to
occupy. The defensive position as it appears finally
is not the result of any one order. It is a gradual
growth planned and executed from day to day. The
first elements may be only a line of individual ‘fox
holes’ dug by the men. These are connected up and
finally form a short section of trench here and there.
As the position is studied more in detail it will become
apparent where other defensive utilities should
be constructed in order to add to the strength of the
position. All that Captain A should include in his
order at this time is sufficient detail to get the work
started.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We have sized up the situation and
arrived at a decision. It is now necessary to put that
decision into an order. We assume that the platoons
have arrived at the rendezvous and the platoon commanders
have reported to you here for orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I want each member of the class to write out
the order that he would give at this time. You may
omit the first paragraph;—information of the enemy
and our own troops. It would be much the same as
that contained in the Major’s order. We will assume
that you have already given that to the platoon commanders.
Start your order with paragraph 2.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all the members of the class have completed
their work the sheets will be collected and again distributed,
making sure that no officer gets his own
paper back again.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The Director will call upon one or more members
of the class to read the order he has in his possession
and it will then be discussed.</p>

<p class='c010'>When all of this discussion is finished the Director
will distribute the mimeographed sheets containing
a copy of the Captain’s order. Each member of the
class will receive his solution back again and compare
it with the solution submitted by the Director.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the area to be occupied
by the 1st platoon and which is to be organized
into a combat group.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant M, are commanding the 1st platoon
which has been designated to form the combat
group in the right half of the company area.</p>

<p class='c010'>The area assigned to your platoon is bounded by
—— (describe area boundaries). Your front extends
from —— to —— (indicate front). The
firing line extends along (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>You have arrived at this point. You have with
you two of your platoon runners. The platoon is
back at the company rendezvous.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>How do you carry out your mission?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will distribute the sheets containing
Situation No. 2. He will read it aloud and make
such explanations as may be necessary. He will
point out to the members of the class the boundaries
of the area assigned to the platoon; the front which
the platoon is ordered to cover; and the location of
the firing line. He will also indicate the position of
each element of Company D in the platoon area and
the location of the 37 mm. gun and light mortar.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—If practicable, the location of machine guns, the 37
mm. gun and light mortar should be indicated by flags of a
distinctive color.)</p>

<p class='c010'>By questioning members of the class the Director
will make sure that every member understands the
situation. They will then be able to proceed with the
solution of the problem on a uniform basis.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, what would you
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would send one of my runners
back with a message to the platoon sergeant to
bring the platoon up.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, do you agree
with what Lieutenant Hunt has just said?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “No, sir. I would not want
the platoon to come up here until I have sized up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>situation; decided upon my dispositions; and made
arrangements for them to get to work on the position
we are to occupy. That will take me some little
‘time.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. There is no
need of exposing any more men to the enemy’s fire
than is absolutely necessary. As soon as the enemy
realizes that our attack has stopped and we are taking
up a defensive position he will do everything in
his power to interfere with our plans. If he observes
a lot of men all along the line digging in he will open
up with everything he has available.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “That is the point I had in
mind. It seems to me that, as a matter of fact, we
will not be able to accomplish very much on the preparation
of the position until it begins to get dusk.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. If we can get the
layout of the position completed during the remaining
full daylight hours; decide how we are to organize
the combat group and get the trenches and other
utilities staked out I think we will have accomplished
all that could be reasonably expected. Do you see
the point, Lieutenant Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—It is assumed that it will be dusk at 6 o’clock.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, taking into consideration
what we have said, what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would send a runner back to
the platoon sergeant to have the men take cover and
make themselves comfortable. I would want them
to have as much rest as possible for they are going
to have a night of hard work. I would have the runner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>tell the platoon sergeant to turn the platoon over
to Sergeant R (platoon guide) and for himself, the
two section leaders and the other platoon guides to
report to me here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that is all right. What
are you going to do while you are waiting for the men
to report to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I will make a personal reconnaissance
of the area, size up the situation and decide
upon how I am going to dispose my troops.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The disposition of troops will, of course, depend upon
the lay of the ground and the location of the machine guns in
the sector. The following procedure is based upon certain dispositions
and is designed to bring out the points that come up
for consideration in the organization of a combat group of this
kind. The Director will have previously worked out his solution
to the problem and during the course of the discussion will
bring out the tactical points that are necessary for the training
and instruction of the members of the class.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what are the
component parts of a combat group?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “First there is the local security
line—the outpost. Behind this is the firing line—the
fighting line of the group. Outguards are
thrown out to back up their sentinels.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How may the deployment of the
platoon be made?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “It may be made with the sections
abreast, each section furnishing the outpost
covering its own front. It may be made with one section
behind the other, the leading section occupying
the firing line.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Which form of deployment do you
favor?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I favor the first. The sections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>deployed abreast and each section providing for its
own local security. The advantages of this is that
the section leader is responsible for the whole front
assigned to him and there is unity of command. If
the outpost line falls back to the firing line it falls
back on the men of its own section. In the second
method, if the outpost section falls back it does so on
the men of the other section of the platoon and there
is bound to be more or less intermingling of units.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. Let us decide
that we are to make the deployment with the sections
side by side, each section to furnish its own
local security—that is, its own outguards. This
means that the front assigned to the platoon may now
be divided into two parts and a section assigned to
each. Lieutenant Wallace, what is the governing
factor in the ground assigned to each of the sections?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Each section must be able to
cover the ground to its front and must be so arranged
as to mutually support each other. That is, its fire
must be able to sweep the front of the adjoining
groups.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, how much
front can a platoon cover in this formation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “In country such as this the
platoon can cover about 400 to 500 yards of front
with its fire. This does not mean that the platoon
occupies such a continuous line. It will actually occupy
only a small portion of it. The intervening portion
will be covered by its fire. By deploying with
the sections abreast of each other we can occupy the
sector allotted to the platoon without any difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span><i>The Director</i>: “What is the extent of the area that
a section may organize for close defense, Captain
Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Ordinarily it should not be
more than 75 yards by 75 yards. This 75-yard front
actually occupied by the section makes 150 yards for
the platoon. The intervening ground of say 150 to
200 yards will be covered by fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I do not see how you arrive at
the short distance of 150 to 200 yards interval between
sections.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “(Indicating by a diagram on
the ground.) Say the right section is 75 yards from
the right boundary of the area; then the section covers
75 yards of trenches; the interval to the section
on the left is say 150 yards; the left section occupies
75 yards of front and is 75 yards from the left boundary.
All of this, as you will see makes a front of
about 450 yards covered by the platoon. The interval
between sections might well be expanded to 200 yards
which would make the platoon cover a front of 500
yards without serious difficulty. This would make
1,000 yards for the company and 2,000 yards for the
battalion with two companies on the firing line. I
would say this is the maximum front. It would be
better to reduce the interval a little and bring the
total down to about 800 yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I see the proposition now. I
do not think we would have any trouble covering the
front allotted to our platoon.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The next question is the allotment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of sections in the platoon area. In this connection
you will have to consider the lay of the ground, and
select the location for the section groups, so that the
ground to the front may best be defended and so
that the groups are able to mutually support each
other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want the members of the class to go over the
ground allotted to the platoon and each of you select
the location of each section group. Keep in mind
the factors I have just spoken of—defense of the
foreground, field of fire, and mutual support of adjacent
groups; also consider the location of the
machine guns that have already been made by the
battalion commander. We will all assemble here in
20 minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The members of the class will now go over the
ground allotted to the platoon and each man will
work out his disposition independently.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the end of the time the class will assemble at the
designated point and the discussion resumed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You have now been over the area
allotted to the platoon. Captain James, how would
you dispose of the two sections of the platoon?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I find that the front naturally
divides itself into two parts. A section in the right
portion of the area will be able to cover the foreground
with its fire. The right element will be able
to cover the front of the combat group to the right
and the left element will be able to sweep the front
of the section on the left. The same applies to the
left section. We can locate our trenches in each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>area so that we not only do not interfere with the
fire of the machine guns but will be able to cover
areas that form dead space for them. I do not think
there will be any difficulty in preparing the position
for defense.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Has any member of the class any
other plan to offer?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The members of the class should be urged to present
their views on the subject. The more discussion that can
be created the better it is for all concerned.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I agree with Captain James. We
can organize the area allotted to the platoon in fine
shape. And this is ordinarily the case with all these
tactical problems. If we go about their solution in a
systematic manner we can usually arrive at a reasonable
and suitable solution to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is another point that must be decided at
this time. That is the location of the platoon command
post. Where would you locate it, Lieutenant
Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I would locate it at ——
(indicate place).”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What factors did you take into
consideration in selecting that location?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “The facilities for observation
and communication with all parts of the combat
group.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Has any member of the class selected
another location for the command post?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—If a member suggests another location it should be
discussed and put to the test of facility for observation and
communication. The place that provides these two elements
the best should be selected.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, there are some other arrangements
that will have to be made before the men can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>actually go to work on the position. In the first
place, they must have the proper tools to work with.
Of course, some work may be accomplished with the
individual intrenching tools that the squads carry,
but they will need a number of regular digging tools
in this case. Wire will have to be supplied for the
construction of the obstacles in front of the position.
It is presumed that the battalion staff will attend to
all of these things, but what the platoon commander
is interested in is when and where will they be supplied.
I think I would send my platoon sergeant to
the company commander to let him know just what
is required and to secure definite information as to
when and where tools and wire will be available. It
is of little use to get a lot of men up to the platoon
area unless they have something to work with. Besides
the area is more or less crowded at this time
with men of the support elements of the 2nd battalion.
These are some of the things that the platoon
commander must think about at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us now assume that the platoon sergeant and
the other men that you sent for have joined you here.
Let us see what orders and instructions you would
give them. Captain Hall, what would you include
in the first paragraph of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “All the information of the enemy
and our own troops. I would explain why it is necessary
for our troops to go on the defensive for a time;
the situation with respect to the 2nd battalion, which
is holding on a short distance to the front; the location
of the troops on our right and left and the role
of the 3rd platoon of our company as support; the location
of the elements of Company D in our area, and
the location of the machine guns in the adjoining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>area; the location of the elements of our company. I
would indicate the location of the firing line where it
crosses our area. I think that is all that is necessary
to be included under information of the enemy and
our supporting troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, what would you
include in the second paragraph of your order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “My plan. This platoon will
organize and hold the front from —— to ——.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “And what would you include in
paragraph 3 of the order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “The disposition of my troops:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The 1st section will organize and hold the front
from —— (indicate) to —— (indicate), connect
up and cooperate with the —— Infantry on the
right.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The 2nd section will organize and hold the front
from —— (indicate) to —— (indicate), connect
up and cooperate with the 2nd platoon on the left.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Each section will furnish its own outguards along
the general line —— (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that is all that is necessary at this time.
I have not gone into details as to just how each section
leader is to solve his problem. I will be along
the line while they are working it out. If they start
anything that I do not approve of, I will have an
opportunity to tell them so at the time. The company
commander has not hampered me with orders
and I will not do so with respect to my section
leaders.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right about that. Give
every man a chance to work out his own salvation.
Do not destroy his initiative. Is there anything to
be included in paragraph 4, Lieutenant Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “Yes, sir. I would give the information
about the intrenching tools and wire being
supplied later. This is done to show my non-commissioned
officers that we have not overlooked the
subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Information concerning issue of intrenching
tools and wire will be given later.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The battalion aid station is at ——.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “And what would be included in the
last paragraph, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “The location of the company
and platoon command posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Company C. P. at ——.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Platoon C. P. at ——.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that would cover all that
is necessary at this time. Let us visualize what is
now going to happen. The section leaders with their
section guides would go out to the area that has been
assigned to them. They would locate the machine gun
positions that were designated by the battalion
commander and then dope out the disposition that
they are to make of the three squads of their respective
sections.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The platoon commander is first concerned with
the procurement of the intrenching tools for digging
in his groups and the wire for constructing an obstacle
along the front. As soon as he gets the platoon
sergeant off with a message to the company commander
about these things he will go to the front and
join the section leaders. He will find out from them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>what dispositions they are planning on and give
them such detailed instructions as may be necessary
to carry out his own ideas of how the position should
be organized. He will have everything in readiness
to bring the men forward as soon as it is advisable to
do so.”</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 3</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant K, commanding the 2nd section,
have been ordered to organize and hold the front
from —— (indicate) to —— (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'>The section is to connect up and cooperate with the
2nd platoon on the left.</p>

<p class='c010'>Your section is to furnish its own outguards along
the general line —— (indicate).</p>

<p class='c010'>You have arrived at this point.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have with you your section guides.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>How do you carry out your mission?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “While it is not expected that any
member of the class will ever be called upon to command
a section of Infantry, it is nevertheless important
for you to know what happens when you issue
an order which requires the action of a section leader.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us visualize this situation. Let us consider
ourselves as being Sergeant K. He is the fellow that
all the orders finally get down to and the one that has
to do the real job out here on the line. You hear the
claims of certain staff corps, from time to time, about
the necessity for having high-class men for the key
positions in their enlisted personnel. Can you show
me in any branch of the Army where a high-class man
is required any more than he is right here? Here is a
doughboy sergeant face to face with a problem, the
proper solution of which means more to the success
of the operations than any so-called “highly technical”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>position in the back areas. Upon what he does
and how he does it may depend the success or failure
of this whole military operation. The lives of the
men under him are absolutely in his hands. If he
blunders he may lose all of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With these few remarks let us proceed with the
problem.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will read the situation aloud, and
make such explanations as may be necessary. He
will call on one or more members of the class to state
his understanding of the situation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, how would
you go about your task?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “In the first place, I would
look over the front and see what it affords in the way
of a field of fire. I would next locate the section
groups on the right and left and see where their fire
could help to protect my front and how fire from my
position could help to protect their fronts. I would
see how the bands of fire from the machine guns in
the area lay with relation to my front.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director will point out the location of the adjacent
section groups on the right and left and the position of the
machine guns. He will also indicate the direction of the bands
of fire of the machine guns. All of this should be indicated by
flags of distinctive color if it is possible to do so.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You have done all of the things
you mention and the whole layout is clear to you.
What is your next step?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would search out the
vacant spaces—the uncovered ground of the machine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>guns and so arrange my dispositions to cover
them. I would first determine where my automatic
rifles may be employed to the best advantage. I will
want them for flanking fire to cover the adjacent
combat groups and will expect the support of their
automatic rifles to help cover my own front. I will
want them to cover exposed places to the front that
the enemy will have to pass over in making his attack.
I will want them to cover certain lines along
my wire entanglements. All of these things will have
to be taken into consideration in locating them. I
will next consider my other special weapons, the rifle
grenade and the hand grenade. They are both valuable
adjuncts to the defense, especially the rifle
grenade. They will both serve well to cover dead
spaces that are difficult to reach with machine gun
and rifle fire. Such features as ravines, sunken
roads and places where enemy troops may seek cover
can be made untenable by the rifle grenade up to
about 200 yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right, let us assume that all of
these things have been taken into consideration.
How may the troops be disposed to best meet them,
Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “We have three squads in the
section. We are required to furnish our own outguards
in addition to furnishing the garrison for the
firing line. I should say that one squad employed
on the outpost line would be sufficient. That would
leave two squads for the firing line.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, there are two plans by which
the outguards may be furnished. One is to have each
squad cover its own front with an outguard and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>other is to have a complete squad detailed as outguard
for the section. Which of these plans do you
prefer to use in this instance, Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I think it would be better to
employ one squad as the outguards for the section
rather than have each squad do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What factors lead you to such a
decision?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “If we have each squad furnish
an outguard for its own front it would take half
of the squad for that purpose. The least that could
be sent out would be a cossack post of four men—a
leader and three reliefs for a single sentinel post.
I would not want to send our automatic riflemen on
that duty and interfere with our arrangements for
flanking fire. We would not desire to send our rifle
grenadier under ordinary circumstances. This would
leave only two rifles in the squad and one of these is
the squad leader. If we send one squad out to furnish
the outguards it can furnish two cossack posts,
which are sufficient to cover our front, and it will
leave the other two squads intact to occupy the firing
line with all their weapons. If the enemy attacks
and the outguards are driven in they will fall back
on the flanks so as not to mask the fire of the squads
on the firing line. This will enable them to drift toward
an assembly point or trench in rear of the
firing line proper where they will be available to the
section commander as a small local support to be
thrown in any of the squad firing positions where
casualties have been relatively heavy or to put them
in where they are most needed to repel the attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Of course it is always problematical
as to how many men of the outguards will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>able to get back; your points are well taken and convincing.
I agree with you that the outguards may
best be furnished by a complete squad, and this leaves
the other units intact for the firing line proper. This
now brings us down to the location of two small
groups of a squad each. Captain Hodges, what factors
will you consider in locating these two groups?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would want one near each
flank of the area where they can help cover the front
of the adjacent groups, and I would want also to
cover the front of the position. In order to do this I
would break each squad into two groups of four men
each. In the right group I would have the automatic
rifleman and three riflemen of the 1st squad. The
automatic rifleman would have a fire position from
which he can cover the front of the adjacent section
on the right, and if the one position does not serve
the purpose I will have another fire position for him
from which he can fire to the front. In the next
group of four men I would have the rifle grenadier
and three riflemen. They will be charged with covering
the front. The group that the squad leader
will remain with will depend upon circumstances. He
would not be definitely assigned, but would go where
his presence is most required. I would have a group
of four men of the 2nd squad next to the left with
the rifle grenade in it, and near the left of my line I
would have another group similar to the one on the
right with the automatic rifleman in it. The 3rd
squad will furnish the outpost—two cossack posts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you have made a very good
distribution of troops. I do not think you can say
off hand that you would have the rifle grenadier always
in the interior groups. His position must depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>upon the prospective targets that he may have.
Now, the distribution brings us down to the proposition
of the preparation of four short sections of
trench sufficient to shelter four men each. This
makes it a comparatively simple proposition. You
see, when you divide all of this work up in the way
we have how it gradually clears up and becomes perfectly
simple.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us now locate on the ground the four short
sections of trench that will have to be prepared.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class will now be conducted to the right of the
section area and then along the front, and the exact
location of the four short trenches will be determined
upon. Each will then be traced on the ground so that
the members of the class may see just the sector front
that it may cover. If additional pits are required
for the automatic riflemen they will also be indicated
on the ground. One or more members of the class
may be required to lie down on the ground and verify
the field of fire from each trench.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain James, we have made a
mark on the ground for each of these short trench
lengths; we call that a trace; what do you mean by
that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “That the line we have made is the
upper edge of the interior slope of the parapet of the
trench. It is the firing line of the trench.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now we have located these
trenches; you have noted the distance apart they are.
Would we try to connect them up with a continuous
trench under the circumstances, Lieutenant Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “No, sir. I think not. If any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>continuous trench is to be constructed it seems to me
that it should be dug a few feet to the rear and
parallel to our line of short trenches. Our short
trenches can then be connected up with it by communication
trenches running obliquely, to give cover
from fire. I think this parallel trench should be
traced now so that work can be commenced on it tonight
after the fire trenches are completed. It should
be a zigzag trench. The 3rd squad can get some
work done on it before they have to go on outpost.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we have covered everything
that is necessary preliminary to issuing the
order of the section commander except the location
of the command post. Where would you locate it,
Captain Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would locate it here (indicates).
The questions of observation and communication are
the determining factors in its selection.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now I want each member of the
class to write out this order that Sergeant K would
issue to his section guides. Make it simple and to
the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The members of class will write out the order on
their pads and when all have completed it the sheets
are passed to the officer on the left for criticism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will read aloud the order he has prepared
and the members of the class compare their
work with it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>The Order</h4>

<p class='c022'>“There is no further information of the enemy. You
know the location of the machine guns in this area; the
location of the 37 mm. gun and light mortar of the Howitzer
company and the location of adjoining groups.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our section will organize and hold this area.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“The 1st squad will prepare the two fire trenches we
have traced in the right of the area. Sergeant F, you
will superintend the task.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 2nd squad will prepare the two fire trenches we
have traced in the left of the area. Sergeant G, you will
superintend the task.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The 3rd squad will furnish the outguards along the
line ——. I will give Corporal B detailed instructions
later.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When the fire trenches have been completed work
will be started on the parallel that we have traced.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Work will begin as soon as we get the section up
and pushed to completion as rapidly as possible tonight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Section C. P. at ——.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The section leader will return to
the company and get the section ready to come to the
front. He will go himself rather than send one of
the guides. There may be some new orders or instructions
from the company or platoon commander,
and he will want to get them first hand. He will
want to be sure that the section is supplied with the
intrenching tools that are necessary for the rapid
prosecution of the mark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The section guides will each mark the cutting
lines for the section of trench that he is responsible
for and those of the communication parallel. They
will have everything in readiness to start work as
soon as the men get up to the position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have gone into considerable detail in the solution
of the problem, but I am sure every member
of the class now realizes the necessity for it and how
simple the final solution is. When we started out
with the problem I am sure you all felt like we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>entering upon a hopeless task but when you finally
get down to the last analysis of it and find that the
pressing problem is the digging of four short sections
of trench capable of sheltering four men each
and getting started on the communication parallel
you realize that it is not such a big proposition
after all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All of this shows the necessity for the systematic
training of officers and men in these things. I am
sure you can see what would happen to an untrained
outfit blundering into a proposition of this kind.
You can readily imagine a company rushing madly
to the front with no one to tell the men where to go or
what to do. These tactical situations that confront
troops in time of war require time and forethought
for their solution. Unless the proposition is gone
about in a systematic and orderly manner the task is
hopeless. I feel sure that if any of you were confronted
with the task of organizing a defensive position
in the face of the enemy you are better equipped
for the solution of the task for having had this Terrain
Exercise.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>General Situation</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The (<i>a</i>) forms the boundary between hostile states.
The Blue Corps has crossed the boundary. Its advance
has been stopped by a Red force of two divisions
at (<i>b</i>).</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Special Situation, Blue</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>In a general attack by the Blue Corps, the ——
Division is attacking with (<i>c</i>) regiments abreast in
the sector bounded on the right (<i>d</i>) by (<i>e</i>) and on the
left (<i>d</i>) by (<i>e</i>). The order of the regiments from
right to left is (<i>f</i>). Each regiment has one battalion
in the assault, one in regimental reserve, and one in
brigade or division reserve (<i>g</i>). The —— Battalion
—— Infantry, is the assaulting battalion of the ——
Infantry (<i>h</i>). The right (<i>d</i>) boundary of the battalion
is (<i>e</i>). Its left (<i>d</i>) boundary is (<i>e</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The battalion is deployed with Company (<i>i</i>) on the
right and Company (<i>k</i>) on the left, as assault companies,
and Company (<i>l</i>) as the reserve company.
The machine gun company (<i>m</i>) and one platoon of
the howitzer company are operating with the battalion.</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Special Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The division began a general advance at (<i>n</i>) today.
At (<i>o</i>), when the scouts reached (<i>p</i>) they were
stopped by fire from the vicinity of (<i>q</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>At (<i>r</i>), Major X at (<i>s</i>), received a message from
the right (left) assault company that it was held up
by fire from (<i>t</i>). The message stated that the company
would assault at (<i>u</i>) by building up a firing
line at (<i>v</i>) and having a platoon attack in the direction
of (<i>w</i>), and requested the assistance of the machine
guns and auxiliary weapons. At the same time
Major X received a message from the left (right)
assault company that it had encountered slight resistance
from (<i>x</i>), but was continuing to advance.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the time Major X received the messages the
machine gun company was located as follows: The
1st and 2nd Platoons were in rear of the right and
left assault companies, respectively, at (<i>y</i>), with
guns mounted on carts. The captain with his headquarters’
detail was with Major X.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation of Symbols</h4>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>) In designating the boundary line, some natural
topographical or geographical feature should be
selected, such as a river, creek, road, state boundary,
etc. In this problem the boundary may be some
miles from the point where the problem starts and in
the opposite direction from the direction of attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) A general defensive position in rear of the
ground selected for the problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) Two, three or four regiments would be placed
in the first line depending on the frontage assigned
to the division and other conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) Compass direction—north, south, east, or
west.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>e</i>) Describe boundaries by roads, creeks, towns,
points, etc. Distance between boundaries should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>such as to give appropriate frontage to the division—about
500 yards for each battalion employed as an
assaulting battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>f</i>) Give order by enumerating regiments as—1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th Infantry.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>g</i>) The number of battalions in assault and in
reserve may vary in different regiments, depending
upon the frontage assigned to the regiment and the
nature of its task.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>h</i>) If the regiment has more than one battalion
in the first line, the text should read: “Is the right
(left) assault battalion of —— Infantry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>i</i>), (<i>k</i>), (<i>l</i>), (<i>m</i>) Use letters appropriate to the
companies of the designated battalion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The action taken by Major X and the orders actually
issued by him.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Machine Gun Company is organized and equipped
in accordance with Table of Organization 29-W. See Appendix
I.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are assembled at <i>s</i>, the
point where Major X receives the messages from his
assault companies.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Before taking up the problem for
solution, I wish to make a few remarks upon the employment
of a machine gun company with an assault
battalion.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The following, in general terms,
are the principal tasks of the machine guns on the
offensive:</p>

<p class='c010'>“(1) To cover the deployment of the infantry and
its advance to the first firing position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(2) To support the attack of the infantry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(3) To support the infantry in continuing the
attack or taking up the pursuit after the enemy’s
main position has been captured.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(4) To assist in the consolidation of the position
whenever the limit of the advance is reached or the
infantry is brought to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the combat the function of the machine
guns is to assist constantly the advance of the infantry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>by fire power. The use of machine guns only at
decisive points in the fight is not sufficient. They
must be so used as to exert a continuous influence
from the beginning to the end of the fight. They can
act by fire alone and cannot be used as assault troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Every assaulting infantry battalion habitually
retains and employs its machine gun company. The
machine gun company almost invariably acts under
the direct orders of the battalion commander. Only
in very exceptional cases will the company act under
the orders of the regimental machine gun officer after
H hour, although he frequently will prescribe tasks
for it during the barrage prior to H hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The following are suitable tasks for a machine
gun company of an assault battalion:</p>

<p class='c010'>“(1) To support the assault companies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(2) To protect the flank of the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(3) To occupy an interval in the line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(4) To assist in consolidating the captured
ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“(5) To assist in resuming the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Orders.</i>—The orders of Major X for the use of
the machine guns should be clear and concise and
should assign definite tasks to them. The orders,
prior to attack, should assign the machine guns a
definite place in the formation and should give them
the mission of supporting the infantry by fire. The
control of the machine guns should be exercised, as
far as possible, through the commanding officer of
the machine gun company. Platoons should be assigned
to support rifle companies, but should not be
placed under the command of rifle company commanders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>without there are exceptional reasons for
so ordering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Formation.</i>—Generally the formation of a machine
gun company supporting an infantry battalion
will be with one platoon on either flank supporting
the two assaulting companies. As to whether or not
the platoons should be placed in rear of the assault
companies or in rear of the reserve company depends
upon conditions. If the conditions indicate the
probable early use of machine guns and the ground
is favorable for their use, they should be placed in
rear of the assault companies. On the other hand, if
their use appears improbable, or the ground is unfavorable
for overhead fire, they should be placed in
rear of the reserve company, where they can use their
carts as long as possible. The formation within the
platoon conforms to the infantry with which it is advancing.
The usual formations will be: when dismounted,
line of squad columns or line of skirmishers;
when mounted, column of squads. The purpose
of the formation taken should be to make it difficult
for the enemy to distinguish the machine guns from
the infantry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Communication.</i>—Where conditions permit, the
commanding officer of the machine gun company will
be with the battalion commander. However, the captain
must not let this consideration interfere with the
efficient command of his company. Where the captain
does not remain with the major he will maintain
contact with him by means of two runners from the
machine gun company.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Director will endeavor to answer any questions
that may be asked by members of the class.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all questions have been cleared up the Director
will hand a copy of the problem to each member
of the class. A few minutes will be allowed to
read over the problem.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Please give me your attention
while we go over the problem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director reads the problem aloud, pointing
out the features of the landscape that are referred
to in the problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director then calls upon one or more members
of the class to explain the problem. He clears
up any point that does not appear plain to all and
satisfies himself that all members of the class understand
the situation and what is required of them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Smith, we shall assume
that you are commanding the battalion and that Captain
M, the commanding officer of the machine gun
company, is with you. What would you do when you
received the messages from your assault companies?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “I would send for all of the captains
to report to me at once, so that I could issue my
orders.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The captains of the two assault
companies are engaged with the enemy, and it is most
essential that they remain in immediate command of
their companies. The captain of the reserve company
is at some distance from Major X. While it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>is extremely desirable to issue one complete verbal
order to the battalion so that any misunderstanding
can be cleared up, it is not practicable to issue such
an order in this case. Captain Scott, what would
you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Scott</i>: “I would take a look at the positions
of the right assault company, the machine gun
company, and the terrain, to determine whether it
would be possible to support the assaulting company
by overhead machine gun fire. I see that there is an
excellent position for the machine guns and howitzer
platoon. The commanding officers of these organizations
are with me, so I at once give them the following
verbal orders:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Company —— has encountered heavy fire from (<i>t</i>).
It will attack at (<i>u</i>) by building up a firing line at (<i>v</i>),
and having a platoon attack in the direction of (<i>w</i>). A
red rocket from this platoon will indicate the beginning
of the attack.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Stokes mortar will lay down a barrage in front
of the platoon, advancing in the direction of (<i>w</i>). The
one-pounder will be in readiness to engage any hostile machine
guns that open fire.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The machine guns will open fire from this hill at (<i>u</i>),
covering the enemy’s position at (<i>t</i>).</p>

<p class='c017'>“Battalion ammunition point 500 yards east of this
point in edge of woods.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall remain here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is an excellent order. It
shows that you understand that Major X should first
attempt to give assistance by the use of his machine
guns and auxiliary weapons and not by the use of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>reserve. The reserve company should not be employed
as long as the assaulting companies can overcome
the resistance with the assistance of the machine
guns and auxiliary weapons. Fire power
should be made to take the place of man-power to the
greatest extent that is practicable. You have also
given an excellent example of the proper coordination
of the machine guns and Stokes mortar. The
ground in the direction of (<i>w</i>) is such that the machine
guns could not effectively support the platoon
advancing in that direction. The Stokes mortar,
however, can search this ground and provide covering
fire for the platoon. Your ordering a red rocket
to be fired by the platoon advancing in the direction
of (<i>w</i>) shows that you understand the necessity for
synchronizing the launching of the attack and the
opening of fire by the machine guns and auxiliary
weapons. However, the steps that you have taken
are not adequate to secure this. You have failed to
notify the commanding officer of the right assault
company of the time that the machine guns will open
fire and have not directed him to have his platoon
fire a red rocket at the beginning of its attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Howe, tell us how you would notify the
commanding officer of the assault companies of your
plans.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Howe</i>: “I would send a written message
by a runner as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Begin your attack at (<i>u</i>). The machine guns will
open fire from (<i>s</i>) at (<i>u</i>). The Stokes mortar will open
fire in the direction of (<i>w</i>) at (<i>u</i>) and will lift their fire

</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “In the situation just completed we
have considered the employment of machine guns
from the point of view of the commander who has the
responsibility for the coordination of the rifle companies
and the machine gun company and for the application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of fire power to save man-power wherever
it is practicable. In the next situation we shall take
up the methods of applying this fire power to support
the rifle companies. These are technical questions
entirely within the province of the machine gun officer.
In the formation the battalion commander designates
the position of the machine gun company
with reference to the rifle companies; the machine
gun company commander determines the formation
within his company. Ordinarily the company commander
will determine whether the guns will go forward
on carts and when it will be necessary to abandon
the carts. The firing position may be designated
by the battalion commander, or it may be left to the
selection of the machine gun company commander.
The manner of occupation of the position is decided
upon by the machine gun officer. The class of fire
to be delivered is a question for the decision of machine
gun officers or non-commissioned officers. The
situation may be such as to require the sections or
platoons to employ different classes of fire. The concentration
of the fire of his platoons is a function of
the machine gun company commander. In the absence
of orders from the battalion commander, the
company commander will determine whether the fire
of the company will be distributed over the front of
the whole battalion or whether it will be concentrated
upon a portion of the front. The method of advance
from one firing position to another will be determined
by the company or platoon commander.
Where the company is employed as a whole the advance
may be by platoon. As a rule, however, the
platoons will advance by alternate sections so that a
rifle company will never be without support. The
duty of maintaining the ammunition supply from
the battalion ammunition point forward to the guns
devolves upon the machine gun captain. The machine
gun company is responsible for communication
forward to the assault companies and to the battalion
commander.”</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Director passes out the papers containing
Special Situation No. 2, reads the situation aloud and
calls upon one or more members of the class to explain
it.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>This consists of copies of the orders of Major X
to the commanding officers of the machine gun company
and howitzer platoon as given by Captain
Scott, and of the message to the commanding officer
of the right assault company as given by Captain
Howe.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The orders actually issued by the commanding officer
of the machine gun company.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Jones, what is the first decision
that Captain M must make when he receives
the order of Major X?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain Jones: “He must decide whether he will
employ the whole company to support the right assault
company or only the platoon which had been
directed to support this company at the beginning of
the fight. Major X has not indicated whether the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>whole company will be employed, so Captain M must
make this decision. The left assault company may
encounter more stubborn resistance, so I should employ
only the right platoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Brown, what do you think
about that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Brown</i>: “I think he should employ the
whole company. Concentration of the fire of the platoons
on points that are holding up the battalion is
one of the duties of the captain. The left assault
company is continuing to move forward and does not
need the support of the left platoon so it should be
used to help advance the right assault company.
There is an excellent firing position directly in its
line of advance and it can be switched to the support
of the left assault company at any time that it becomes
necessary. If the only firing position available
were such that the platoon could not support
the advance of the left assault company, if support
were needed, and the position were so situated as to
cause the left platoon to deviate greatly from its line
of advance, the case would be different. In that situation
I think the left platoon should continue its advance
in rear of the left assault company with the
purpose of bringing flanking fire on the enemy a
little later.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Burt, we shall assume
that Captain M decides to employ both platoons to
support the right assault company. What does he
do next?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Burt</i>: “He would send the buglers to have
the platoon leaders report to him in advance of their
platoons and would direct the reconnaissance officer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to select the firing positions for the two platoons and
obtain the ranges.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The captain has a company headquarters
to assist him in commanding the company
and the use that the captain makes of this headquarters
is a sure indication of the efficiency of the company.
It is impossible for the captain to command
the company by himself and attend to all details.
Part of this headquarters detail is mounted. The
buglers and reconnaissance officer have horses. By
having the platoon leaders precede their platoons
they can receive their orders before the platoons arrive
and be ready to move into position without delay.
When the buglers reach the platoons they would
turn over their horses to the platoon leaders and
would remain with the platoons to guide them to
their firing positions. The reconnaissance sergeant
would assist the reconnaissance officer by taking the
ranges as soon as the positions had been selected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Smith, where would you select the positions
and what frontage would you assign to a platoon?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “I would assign positions at the
crest so that the guns could use direct overhead fire.
The position should be such that the muzzles of the
guns would be just over the crest. In that way the
gunners will have the maximum amount of protection
consistent with direct fire. The distance between
guns should be not less than 20 yards, and preferably
more. I would assign the right half of the
position to the right platoon and the left half to the
left platoon. This will allow a little distance between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>platoons so that the guns will not make such a
conspicuous target.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I wish to emphasize the fact that
you must select a position where the guns can employ
<i>direct fire</i>. Indirect fire is thoroughly practicable
in the beginning of a prepared attack or on the resumption
of an attack that has been stopped for
several hours. Often it is the only kind of fire that
can be employed. However, considerable time is
necessary to prepare for indirect fire, and this situation
does not permit of the delay necessary to prepare
for indirect fire. Direct fire is also more effective
and should be employed whenever possible. It
seldom will be advisable for a machine gun company
of an assault battalion to use indirect fire. There is
a distinct advantage in having an elevated firing position
as the guns are able to give support to the rifle
companies until they approach more closely to the
target.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Jones, what assignment of targets would
you make?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “I would assign a portion of the
target to each platoon. The whole target could be
assigned to each platoon which would permit an entire
platoon to advance to a new firing position, while
the other covered the entire target. However, any
advance before the resistance is overcome would
probably be by section and not by platoon; so there is
no advantage in giving each platoon the whole target.
A gunner can fire more effectively on a narrow target
where it is not necessary to traverse so much.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Howe, would you make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>any provision for lifting your fire as the infantry approaches
the target?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Howe</i>: “I would leave that to the platoon
commanders. The rate of advance may be different
at different parts of the line so that some guns may
continue firing safely after others are forced to stop.
I would want every gun to fire as long as the safety
of the infantry would permit.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Burt, what provision
would you make for opening fire?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Burt</i>: “I would have the platoon leaders
signal me when they were ready and open fire on my
signal. The positions of the platoons are plainly
visible from my position. Since it has been ordered
that fire will open at a definite time I think it better
to depend on one watch than to take a chance of the
platoons opening a few seconds apart.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All of the doubtful points have
been cleared up. Assuming that you would do what
it has been decided that Captain M should do, I want
each of you to write out the complete fire order of
Captain M. It is understood, of course, that Captain
M would give his order verbally, but it is desired
to have you write out this order, so that the form of
the order can be examined more carefully.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>After the solutions have been written, the Director
has one or more members of the class comment on
the solution of other members. The Director then
distributes the sheets containing Situation No. 3,
which is the fire order of Captain M.</p>

<p class='c010'>Actions of and orders actually issued by Lieutenant
Y, commanding the 1st platoon.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Smith, in general what assistants
has the platoon leader and what are their
duties?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “The platoon sergeant takes command
of the platoon when the lieutenant goes forward,
and obtains ranges after the selection of the
firing position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The communication corporal, with the agents
(normally two), maintains communication between
the platoon and the rifle company which it is supporting,
and sends or signals to the platoon the information
necessary to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The transport corporal moves guns and ammunition
carts forward in accordance with the movements
of the platoon. Improvises packs when necessary.
Provides for replenishment of ammunition and replacements
for killed or disabled mules.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are seven privates in the headquarters detail.
One of these is a bicyclist, two are agents to
the rifle company, four runners maintain communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with machine gun company headquarters, with
the sections and the platoon ammunition point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Burt, what would Lieutenant
Y do after receiving the order from Captain
M?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Burt</i>: “He would proceed to the position
assigned to his platoon. He would decide upon the
positions to be assigned to his sections, and observe
the enemy’s position to determine upon an allotment
of targets. As the platoon approached he would halt
it well under the cover of the hill and signal the platoon
sergeant and the section leaders forward. When
they arrived he would issue his fire order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Jones, give the fire order
issued by Lieutenant Y.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “Lieutenant Y gives the following

position at (<i>t</i>). Range 1,300 to 1,400. Combined sights.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Second section, the ridge for 100 yards to the left of
the woods. Range 1,300.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Section leaders will be responsible for lifting their fire
on the approach of the infantry.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Rate of fire 200 for first minute, 150 thereafter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Platoon ammunition point 100 yards down the hill.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall remain here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Howe, what do you think
of telling the 1st section to use combined sights? Explain
the use of combined sights.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Howe</i>: “The target undoubtedly calls for
the use of combined sights. Whether it would be
necessary for Lieutenant Y to direct the use of combined
sights would depend on how well trained the
section leader was. If I were at all doubtful I would
order combined sights.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Combined sights is the method of engaging any
required depth of ground by applying simultaneously
overlapping zones of fire from two or more guns.
The depth of the beaten zone is increased by ordering
different elevations to be used by each gun. This
type of fire is not necessary under 800 meters. When
it is used, as many guns as possible should be employed
with 100 meters difference if the error in range
finding is probably great, and with 50 meters difference
if the error is probably small. This kind of fire
is used either to engage a target which is deeper than
the effective beaten zone or against a small target
when the range is not exactly known.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Burt, explain to the class
how the section leader determines when the fire
should be lifted.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Burt</i>: “The section leader is equipped
with a type EE field glass which has an inverted sight
leaf in the field of view. The glass is used as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Align the inverted sight scale so that the announced
range to the target will coincide with the
target.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the range to the target is 850 meters or less,
note where the line in the graticule representing 1,350
meters cuts the landscape.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the range to the target is 850 meters or over,
add 500 meters to the range to the target, and locate
the point on the landscape that is cut by this line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the point located on the landscape is at or above
the feet of our own troops, it will be safe to fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The gunner in a similar manner determines when
it is safe to fire by means of his rear sight so there is
always a double check.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Smith, do you see any purpose
in ordering a rate of fire of 200 for the first
minute?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “Yes, sir, it is important to place
as great a volume of fire as possible on the enemy at
the beginning of the attack. However, the guns cannot
maintain such a rate for but a few minutes, so it
is necessary to lower it. A rate of 125 to 150 could be
maintained for 20 or 30 minutes, so it is safe to order
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Jones, what do you mean
by the ammunition point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “The machine gun platoon ammunition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>point consists of the transport corporal, one
runner, and the four ammunition carts and four
machine gun carts with their drivers. This ammunition
point is responsible for maintaining the ammunition
supply from the carts forward to the guns.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are correct about the composition
of the ammunition point, but not about its
duties. Its function is to maintain a supply of ammunition
in the carts sufficiently close to the guns
that it can be gotten forward by the ammunition carriers,
but it is not responsible for getting the ammunition
forward. Numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of each
squad are responsible for getting the ammunition
forward from the carts to the guns. The transport
corporal moves the carts forward from one covered
position to another by bounds and keeps the platoon
leader informed of the location of the carts. That is
the reason a runner is assigned to the point. The
corporal is responsible for getting the ammunition
forward from the combat wagons. Normally this
will be done by sending the ammunition carts to the
battalion ammunition point. The machine gun carts
should be kept filled at all times, if possible, and at
the platoon ammunition point ready to move forward
to the guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Brown, what do you think about Lieutenant
Y not ordering emplacements and cover
trenches to be constructed?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Brown</i>: “If there is time before opening
fire the section leader should construct them without
any orders. However, I believe it is always safer to
order the construction. In this case the time is
limited, so it would be best to get the guns into position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and ready to open fire and then begin construction.
Great caution would have to be used, however,
in the construction as emplacements not properly constructed
would show up very distinctly on the crest
and would be a source of danger. Cover trenches behind
the trench would not be visible and would be a
great protection for ammunition carriers.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Howe, no mention was
made in the order of communications, what do you
think of that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Howe</i>: “It is unnecessary if the platoon
is trained properly. It becomes a matter of routine,
and instructions are given only if something out of
the ordinary is required.”</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>A few minutes after fire was opened by the machine
guns, the enemy gave way, and Company —— advanced
and disappeared over the ridge at (<i>t</i>) formerly
held by the enemy. The left assault company
(Company ——) has continued to make progress and
is slightly in advance of the right assault company.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Orders as actually issued by Captain M, commanding
the machine gun company.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The situation is one in which it
would be possible for the battalion commander to
give orders to the machine gun company, but would
be necessary only in case that the company commander
was incompetent. The captain of a company
must not expect to receive orders from the major at
every new phase of the situation. The major is probably
eager to get forward to (<i>t</i>) to see for himself
what the situation is and has no time to tell Captain
M just what he shall do with his company.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Smith, assuming you are Captain M,
what orders would you give to the company?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “I would send the following verbal
message to the platoon commanders:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Advance your platoon by section to the position at
(<i>t</i>).’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “If the enemy were still resisting,
advancing the platoons by alternate sections would
be the normal procedure. However, since the resistance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of the enemy has temporarily ceased and he has
passed over the ridge where he cannot at present fire
on the machine gun company, Captain M has a little
more choice in the formation that he will employ in
advancing the company. It is perfectly practicable
to advance by platoon, and there is some advantage
in so doing as it will leave the platoon commanders in
direct touch with their whole platoons. The left assault
company is slightly in advance of the right, so
it would be better to send the left platoon forward to
the position at (<i>t</i>) and have the right platoon go forward
just as soon as the left platoon has reached
(<i>t</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'>“Captain Jones, what do you think of immediately
sending the whole company forward?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “It would not be safe. It is too
early to know whether the enemy will counter-attack.
If he should counter-attack and drive the infantry
out of the position at (<i>t</i>), part of the machine guns
should be in position to support the infantry. As
soon as it appears that the attack of the infantry has
succeeded, part of the guns must be sent forward to
give the infantry closer support, but some guns must
be retained in position until danger of a counter-attack
has passed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Burt, would you give the
platoon leaders any additional instructions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Burt</i>: “Yes, sir; I would instruct them to
replenish their ammunition before sending their ammunition
carts forward. They probably would do
this any way, but I would play safe and order it.
There has not been a long period of firing so that one
cart from each section probably would be all that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>would be necessary to send to the rear. This would
leave plenty of ammunition with the guns and get additional
ammunition forward much sooner than if
the ammunition carts were permitted to advance
without refilling.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Howe, would you give any
further instructions to the platoon leaders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Howe</i>: “Yes, sir; I would direct them to
move forward with the guns on carts. The carts have
been placed at the disposal of the platoon leaders so
they should employ them without instructions, as
there is no danger in so doing. However, the captain
usually determines when the guns shall be moved forward
by hand, so I think it is safer to caution them
to use their carts. There is a great tendency to continue
advancing the guns by hand for the rest of the
fight when it has once become necessary to dismount
them from the carts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Smith, give the complete
messages that should be sent to the platoon leaders to
carry out the decisions we have made.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Smith</i>: “Captain M would send the following
verbal messages:</p>

<p class='c017'>“To the commander of the 2nd platoon:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Move forward at once with guns on carts to the position
from which the enemy has just been driven. Replenish
ammunition.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“To commander of 1st platoon:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Replenish your ammunition. Remain in position
until 2nd platoon reaches position from which enemy has
just been driven and then move forward with guns on
carts.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><i>The Director</i>: “We have covered the different situations
that are likely to occur in an attack with the
exception of the opening phases of a prepared attack
and the consolidation. The former is most frequently
an indirect fire problem and should be treated
as a separate exercise. The latter can be handled best
as the first phase of a battalion on the defensive.”</p>

have been detailed to form the advance party. It is
now (<i>h</i>). Your platoon is formed here.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The action that you, Lieutenant W, take, and the
orders you issue to your platoon.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are assembled at (<i>g</i>) on
the (<i>n—o</i>) road (see explanation of symbols), where
it is intended that the advance guard formation is to
be taken up.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Before taking up the problem for
solution, I want to make a few remarks on the formation
of a column of troops on the march and to review
briefly the formation and duties of an advance
guard.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “A column of troops on the march
consists of a main body and such covering detachments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>as may be necessary. These covering detachments
are denominated advance guards, rear guards
and flank guards. They are thrown out for the purpose
of gaining information of the enemy, to protect
the main body from surprise, and to hold off the
enemy a sufficient length of time for the main body
to prepare for action.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The covering detachment that goes ahead of and
protects the march of a marching column is called an
‘advance guard.’ It consists of a series of detachments
or groups increasing progressively in strength
from head to rear, each being charged with the protection
of the group immediately following it from
surprise and thus gaining time for the latter to get
ready to fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Formation.</i>—The advance guard is normally divided
into a support and a reserve. From the support,
an advance party is sent to the front a few hundred
yards, and from this advance party a small
patrol, technically called a ‘point,’ is sent out. From
time to time as the occasion demands, patrols are sent
out to the right and left. These are called ‘flankers.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the advance guard consists of a small force
the reserve is omitted and we have only a support,
from which an advance party is sent out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the problem we have an advance guard composed
of one rifle company of infantry. What is the
proper formation?</p>

<p class='c010'>“The advance party will consist of one platoon,
from which a ‘point’ of one squad will be sent out to
the front, a distance of about 200 yards. The remainder
of the company will constitute the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and follow the advance party at a distance of about
400 yards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do away with a reserve. It would divide the
company into too many component parts and make
control just that much more difficult.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what may be termed the usual formation.
Conditions may be such that it would be desirable to
make the advance party stronger; as where the enemy
habitually opposes us with relatively small detachments
and we want to run over them and drive them
off without bringing the support into action.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In any case you must have a knowledge of the
functions of an advance guard. You must know the
mission and be able to size up the situation of the particular
case. You must then use your plain commonsense
in meeting the situations as they develop.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Duties.</i>—Now let us see what the duties of the
advance guard are:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. To prevent the main body of our troops from
being fired into while they are in a formation that
prevents them from defending themselves. You can
imagine what would happen if an effective fire were
suddenly poured into the company while it is marching
in column of squads on the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. To gain information of the enemy by sending
out detachments to the front and flanks at such points
as may be necessary. Here is an important thing to
remember. Under the conditions of modern warfare,
the haphazard method of sending out flanking
patrols has every chance of resulting in disaster.
These men never get back in time to be of use to you
when you need them. Much of this patrolling and
marching of flanking detachments across country is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>exhausting and wears out your troops. It should be
reduced to the minimum.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. To push back small parties of the enemy. The
progress of the main body must not be arrested by
small, comparatively insignificant detachments of
the enemy. It is the duty of the advance guard to
brush them aside. How many times at maneuvers
have you seen a skillfully handled patrol make a
whole advance guard deploy? It should have been
swept away by the advance party. The idea is, that
you simply have to keep pushing to the front until
you really encounter something that will stop you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. To check the advance of the enemy in force
long enough for the main body to prepare for action.
When the enemy is met in sufficient force to warrant
the employment of troops of the main body there is a
certain process that the commander has to go through
before he can get his troops in action. A reconnaissance
must be made to determine the strength and
disposition of the enemy, for it would be folly to commit
a force to action without knowing something of
these elements. Then, too, the orders for the deployment
have to be issued and the deployment has to be
effected. All of this takes a certain amount of time
during which period the advance guard holds off the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“5. To remove obstacles, repair the roads, and
favor in every way the uninterrupted progress of the
main body.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These are the duties of the advance guard. These
are the things that platoon, section and squad leaders
must ever keep in mind when they are on advance
guard duty. These are the things that we officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>must learn about in time of peace in order that we
may do them as a matter of habit in time of actual
service.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Distances.</i>—The distances between the several
elements of the advance guard are fixed by the general
rule that ‘the element in front must be at such
a distance that the next succeeding element will not
be involved in a disaster to the former.’</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Formation of Advance Guard of One Company for a Battalion</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The point will be from 150 to 200 yards in advance
of the advance
party. The latter will
be from 300 to 400
yards in front of the
support and the main
body will follow at a
distance of from 400
to 500 yards. It will
thus be seen that the
head of a battalion
with one company as
advance guard will be
about 1,400 yards away
from the enemy.
This allows a minimum
distance of 400
yards from the leading
man of the point
to the enemy. If a
deployment becomes
necessary, it can be
made in comparative
security. These distances
are not fixed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>They are flexible. They may be increased or diminished
to meet the situation. When the advance
guard commander prescribes distances between the
several elements it is not to be taken that the exact
distance will be maintained at all times. It is merely
an indication of the approximate distances desired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Communication.</i>—Communication between the
several elements of the advance guard and with the
main body is kept up by means of connecting files
which march between them. They employ signals
and act as runners when necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are there any questions?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will endeavor to answer any questions
that may be asked by members of the class.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all questions have been cleared up the Director
will hand a copy of the problem to each member
of the class. A few minutes are allowed for the class
to read over the problem.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Please give me your attention
while we go over the problem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director reads the problem aloud, each member
of the class following from the copy in his possession.
The direction of places mentioned are
pointed out.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, give a brief
statement of the tactical situation, as you understand
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lieutenant Williams states his understanding of
the tactical situation. As he proceeds the Director
makes such explanations as may be desirable. One
or more additional members of the class may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>called upon to state their version of the tactical situation.
All of this is for the purpose of fixing the elements
of the problem firmly in the minds of the members
of the class and prevent any subsequent misunderstanding
of them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, you note that
the problem states that our battalion is a right (left)
flank guard. Just what do you understand by that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Ordinarily the flanks of a column
on the march may be protected by small patrols
sent out from the advance guard. There are, however,
occasions when patrols will not suffice and it is
necessary to send out a stronger detachment, to march
along a route essentially parallel to and abreast of
the force. A detachment so sent out is called a flank
guard. In this case our whole battalion is a flank
guard sent out to protect the right (left) flank of our
brigade in its march towards (<i>b</i>).”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What do you understand to be the
duties of a flank guard?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “They are much the same as
those of an advance guard, that is, to do everything
possible to facilitate the uninterrupted progress of
the main body. All other duties are incidental to
this and all have this prime object in view.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Very good. Are there any questions
at this time? Now I want each member of the
class to consider himself as being Lieutenant W, commanding
the first platoon of Company A. Your
platoon is right over there (pointing), formed up in
line, at the right of the company. You, together
with the other officers and non-commissioned officers
of the company, have assembled here and have received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the verbal orders of the captain for the formation
of the company as the advance guard of the
battalion. You are now ready to return to your platoon.
Just how are you going to do the job that has
been assigned to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will now conduct the class to the
point where the first platoon is supposed to be.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, we will assume
that you are commanding the platoon. Just
how do you go about the task of getting started on
the day’s work?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I should first see if all the
men are present, and then I would inspect the platoon
to make sure that everything is all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The first part of your problem is
simple. All you have to do is to glance down the
ranks to determine whether every man is in his
proper place. Let us assume that all are present.
Now, with regard to the proposition of the inspection.
In campaign the platoon commander should
inspect his platoon at reveille—check up the appearance
of the men and note the condition of the arms
and equipment. At this time he should take the
steps necessary to remedy deficiencies and make provision
for the evacuation of any man that is physically
unfit. This should be a matter of routine.
Then, when the day’s work is to be started, there is
no delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I see the point and realize
the necessity for the procedure you have outlined.
There is one other point. When should the rifles be
loaded?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><i>The Director</i>: “Some advocate that the rifles
should be loaded and the safety locks turned to
‘Safe’ just after the inspection in the morning. I
do not believe that to be the best procedure. It increases
the chances for an accident. I would have
the men load their rifles, in this case, just before
starting to form the advance party. Let us assume
that the platoon has been inspected at reveille and
that all the men are in fit physical condition and
ready for the work in hand. What is the first move
you would make, Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “Well, sir, I would want to
get the platoon a short distance away from the rest
of the company. So the first thing I do is to march
the platoon about 75 to 100 yards up the road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the idea?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “There is always more or less
confusion around the company on an occasion of this
kind, and I want to get my platoon off by themselves
so they can give me their undivided attention while I
am issuing my orders and getting them all set for
the work in hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a very good reason.
Let us assume that you have moved the platoon
100 yards away from the rest of the company. You
are formed up in line. What are you going to do
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would have the men load
their rifles.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right; you have done that.
Captain Harvey, what is the next step?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would take a few minutes to
dope out the situation and determine what I am going
to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><i>The Director</i>: “That is time well spent. Now let
us go through the process you have just mentioned.
What is the first thing you are to determine?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “What is the mission of the platoon?
It is to form the advance party.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the next step, Captain
Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “To consider the enemy—where
he is, what he is doing, and what he is likely to do.
In this case the only information we have is that
small forces of the enemy are reported in the direction
of (<i>c</i>). We have no information of his strength
or composition or what he is doing. We must be prepared
to meet him at any time and govern our action
accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the next step, Captain
Mason?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Mason</i>: “To consider our own supporting
forces. We know that our brigade is to march
towards (<i>b</i>) by the (<i>j</i>)—(<i>k</i>)—(<i>l</i>) road. That our
battalion continues its mission as a right (left) flank
guard. That our company, less this platoon, is the
support, which follows us at a distance of about 400
yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What is the next step, Captain
Jones?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “We then consider our plans of
action—what we are going to do. There is no information
on which to base our plans very far ahead.
We can only get the advance party into the most
favorable formation and be prepared for eventualities.
We will have a point, consisting of one squad,
precede the advance party at about 200 yards. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>rest of the platoon will march in column of twos, a
file on each side of the road. From this formation
a rapid deployment can be made, and we are always
ready to meet the enemy. Measures for local protection
will be taken as the march progresses.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, what is the next
step in this process?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “Based upon what has been
said before we arrive at a decision as to what we are
going to do. In this case it would be—To march at
(<i>m</i>) o’clock by the (<i>n</i>)—(<i>o</i>) road as advance party
of the advance guard. We then embody this decision
in a field order and issue it verbally to the platoon.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “All of that which we have just discussed
is what we call the ‘Estimate of the Situation.’
It is simply a sizing up of the tactical situation
in a logical and systematic manner. The commander
of troops who fails to do this fails to do
everything possible to promote the success of the
military operation he is about to undertake—he does
not take advantage of all the aids at his disposal.
The commander who blunders into action without
sizing up the situation as we have outlined here is
doomed to failure and disaster. It may be an operation
in which there is little to consider—where there
is little choice of methods—but you should religiously
go through the process, even if only a few minutes
of time are available.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At this point I want to invite your attention to
the merits of the simple five paragraph field order
provided for in our Field Service Regulations. The
elements of it are:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Paragraph 1. Information of the enemy and our
own troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 2. The plan of the commander, stated
in general terms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 3. Orders for the several elements of
the command.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 4. Administrative and communication
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paragraph 5. The place where messages are to
be sent, or where the commander will march.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This form of field order has stood the test of time
and, what is more to the point, it has proved to be a
suitable and effective method of issuing orders in
time of war. When we went to France we found the
long-winded, highly detailed orders that were the
development of years of trench warfare. No one
read them and, if they did, they did not understand
them. We used them in order to conform with requirements
from higher headquarters. When we
really got down to the business of fighting and had
to produce results we fell back on our own simple
five paragraph order, and it met all the requirements.
Get the elements of this order firmly fixed in your
minds and follow them. They are applicable to any
body of troops, large or small.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next point I want to bring out is the necessity
for letting every man in the platoon know what the
work for the day is to be. This information is imparted
to them in the form of a verbal order by the
platoon commander, which embraces the points
brought out in the ‘Estimate of the Situation,’ which
we have just discussed.”</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, based upon the decision
reached in our ‘Estimate of the Situation’ and
the discussion prior thereto, state your solution of
the problem in detail.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I give the command: 1. Platoon,
2. ATTENTION; then follow with: 1. With ball
cartridges, 2. LOAD. After all pieces are loaded and
locked, I give the command: 1. Order, 2. ARMS. I
then give the command: AT EASE, and direct: ‘Give
me your attention.’ I then issue my order as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Small Red forces are reported in the direction of (<i>c</i>)

<p class='c017'>“‘Private Allen (rifleman from front rank, second

I will then signal the point: FORWARD MARCH.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. Now I want
each member of the class to write out the order of the

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>Each member of the class writes out the order of
the advance party commander. When all have completed
this the Director collects the work and distributes
it, making sure that no member of the class receives
his own solution back again.</p>

<p class='c010'>One or more of the solutions are read aloud, and a
discussion of any errors or points of importance is
conducted. At the conclusion of this the Director
inquires if there are any questions. He endeavors

which the class is ready to go ahead with the next

</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “In our solution to Situation No. 1,
Captain Hall, in giving the order of the platoon commander
said: ‘Sergeant Roberts, with the first squad,
will form the point, etc.’ That was an eminently
proper order. It did not go into details. He assumes
that Sergeant Roberts is familiar with the
methods of forming the point of an advance guard
and conducting its operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a very simple matter for the platoon commander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to pass the order along to the sergeant in
this manner. But unless the platoon commander
knows how the work should be done he has no means
of checking up and seeing to it that it is done
properly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“While it is not contemplated that any member of
this class will ever be called upon to conduct the operations
of the point of an advance guard, all should
be familiar with what happens when he gives someone
else an order to do so.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director passes out the papers containing Situation
No. 2, reads the situation aloud and calls upon
one or more members of the class to give their understanding
of it.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant Roberts, have been designated to
command the point, consisting of the first squad.
Your men have been turned over to you by the platoon
commander. You have been ordered to move
out and get your distance and formation.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Sands, what is a point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Sands</i>: “A point is an element of an advance
guard that precedes the advance party.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is right, and it is no more or
less than a fighting patrol that is assigned a definite
line of march. Its operations are conducted on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>basis. It can afford to be bold and aggressive because
the advance party is close at hand to back it
up. What factors govern the formation of the point,
Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “The point must have a formation
that renders it the least vulnerable to hostile
fire. This means dispersion. On the other hand,
the dispersion should not be so great that the commander
is not able to control its operations. I
should say that a patrol formation, where the men
march in pairs on opposite sides of the road, would
be suitable.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What should be the distances between
the men?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Twenty to 25 yards. That
distance would provide the necessary dispersion, and
at the same time there would be sufficient compactness
to insure control.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Where will the point commander
march, Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “He should march at the head
of the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you agree with that statement,
Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “No, sir; I do not. It seems to
me that the commander should be free to go wherever
he is needed. He should not be tied down to
any one place.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I agree with you. There are other
reasons why he should not habitually march at the
head of the point. In the first place, the man at the
head of the point must always be on the lookout for
the enemy, and if the point commander is the man his
whole attention will be devoted to that task and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>will be very little leadership exercised in the point.
Again, we do not want to take a chance on our point
commander becoming a casualty unnecessarily. He
has been placed in command, presumably because
he is the best man fitted for the job. He knows the
plans for the day’s work better than any of the other
men. If he becomes a casualty on the first few shots,
there may be no one to take his place without some
confusion and delay. If the point commander
marches a little distance back, say in the second or
even third pair, he will be sufficiently close to the
front to perform his duty. I prefer to have him in
the second pair. Before leaving this subject of the
formation of the point I would like your opinion,
Captain Hughes, on the question of deploying the
men in a line of skirmishers at extended intervals.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hughes</i>: “That might be all right after
the enemy is encountered, but I would not do it on an
ordinary march. In the first place, it would be rough
going for the men off on the flanks of the road, and
they could not keep up. If the rate of march is held
down to keep abreast of them, the progress of the
main body will be delayed. In the next place, if the
intervals are too much extended, the point commander
will not be able to control the operations and will
not have his men where he wants them at the critical
moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Your reasons seem to be logical and
possess merit. Before going further I want to say
a few words about the operations of a point.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The main idea to be instilled into
the minds of the members of a point is that it must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>keep moving. It positively must not stop until absolutely
compelled to do so by the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the enemy is encountered the point commander
will have to size up the situation quickly and
take the necessary action which invariably includes
getting information back to the advance party commander.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The men must look to the leader for instructions
and guidance and await his orders.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hastings, what elements
are included in the orders of a point commander
to the members of his point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hastings</i>: “They are the elements included
in every field order. The point commander
must be sure that every man has all the available information
of the enemy and our own supporting
troops. In this case they were given all of this by the
platoon commander, and it is not necessary for Sergeant
Roberts to repeat it. That is paragraph 1 of
the order. The point commander must then announce
his plans, in general terms, and that constitutes
paragraph 2. Then comes the formation of the
point and giving each man his instructions as to
where he is to march in the formation—paragraph 3.
He must now arrange for communication and follow
with the place where he, himself, is to march. That
completes the order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Captain Harvey, let us assume
that you are Sergeant Roberts. Your squad is
standing here on the road ready to move out. Let
us hear the exact orders that you would give them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I will take post in front of the
squad and command: 1. Squad, 2. ATTENTION.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will then address the men as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You heard what the lieutenant said about the enemy
and our supporting troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘We are going out as the point.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Crane and Hanson (both riflemen), march on the
right and left of the road, respectively. Keep about
abreast of each other.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Pendleton (rifle grenadier), follow Crane and Hanson
at a distance of about 25 yards. March on the right
side of the road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Alley (rifleman) and Stone (carrier for the automatic
rifleman), follow Pendleton at 25 yards distance—Stone
on left, Alley on right of road. Stone, watch the
country to the east and Alley, watch the country to the
west.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Patrick (automatic rifleman) and Corporal Smith follow
Alley and Stone at a distance of about 25 yards—Patrick
on the right, Corporal Smith on the left of road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Bailey (rifleman), follow Patrick and Corporal Smith
at a distance of about 25 yards and watch for signals
from the advance party.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I will march with Pendleton on the left side of the
road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Move out.’”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Are there any questions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Yes, sir. I would like to
ask why Captain Harvey places the automatic rifleman
so far back in the formation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, will you please
explain your reasons?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “If the point encounters the enemy,
we would want to conduct a little reconnaissance
before committing the automatic rifleman to action.
If he is any farther to the front, he is most likely to
get involved early in the encounter and perhaps in a
position hastily chosen, where his weapon could not
produce his maximum effect. The automatic rifle
has the fire power of several rifles, and we want to
take advantage of this fact. We must therefore get
the weapon into the position where it can be done,
and this cannot usually be determined with the first
few shots of an advance guard meeting engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Those are very good reasons—ones
which I believe all the members of this class will remember
when it comes to training their own non-commissioned
officers. Are there any other questions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Why did Captain Harvey
omit to designate a second in command?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The succession in military command
is determined by seniority. Corporal Smith
is the next senior and will automatically assume command.
If there were no non-commissioned officer
with the squad, Sergeant Roberts would have designated
one of the privates as second in command.
Any other questions? (<i>Pause.</i>) There appear to be
none. I wish you would ask questions to bring out
points that are not fully understood. It is by a discussion
of these points that we arrive at a reasonable
solution of these problems. Now, a few remarks before
we pass on to the next situation.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “When you come to the training of
your own men you cannot be too particular about insisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>upon their learning the form of tactical orders
and the language to be used in expressing their contents.
It takes long practice to be able to do this
without getting confused and omitting essentials.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When a non-commissioned officer takes charge of
a detachment for any tactical duty and gives his instructions
in a clear and concise manner, leaving
nothing to be guessed at, he inspires the confidence
of his men. They realize immediately that there is
someone at the helm who knows his business and
they cheerfully respond. Noncommissioned officers

  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted forward along the route
of march of the advance guard for a distance of
several hundred yards. The distance should be such
that the class will at least be beyond the sight of the
starting point in the Terrain Exercise, so that entirely
new terrain will be available. There should be
a considerable stretch of road ahead in sight so that
the various elements of the advance guard could be
seen if they were actually on the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is halted and the Director passes out the
slips containing Situation No. 3.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 3</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>It is assumed that the advance guard has been
marching for a period of two hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain A, marching at the head of the support
of the advance guard, have reached this point.
Nothing has occurred to change the initial formation
of the advance guard.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Point out the formation and location of the various
elements of the advance guard at this moment.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>A few minutes are allowed the members of the
class to look over the situation and get their new
bearings. The Director reads the situation aloud
and inquires whether there are any questions, which
he endeavors to answer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You will note that the situation indicates
that the advance guard is assumed to have
been marching for two hours. This would make the
distance we have marched a little more than 5 miles.
As a matter of fact, we have only come a few hundred
yards from our starting point. You will have to
draw on your imagination in this matter, disregard
all things behind you, and consider only those to the
front. It would consume too much time to actually
go the distance assumed and it is not necessary to do
so, for we are now on new terrain, which serves our
purpose equally as well as if we were the full distance
of 5 miles farther to the front.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “What are the several elements of
the advance guard, Lieutenant Williams?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “First, we have the point,
which is the small body of men farthest to the front;
next, we have a connecting file between the point and
the advance party; next comes the advance party,
then the connecting files between the advance party
and the support, and finally the support, which is
right here on the road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what is the
strength and disposition of these several elements of
the advance guard?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “The point is composed of one
complete squad commanded by a sergeant. It is in
patrol formation, marching on the road with a distance
of about 20 to 25 yards between each pair of
men. The point precedes the advance party by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>distance of about 150 to 200 yards. The connecting
file between that point and advance party marches
so that he can keep both of these bodies in sight. He
has no fixed place where he is to march—”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i> (<i>interrupting</i>): “Right there
is a point that I want to bring up. I can conceive of
a situation where the connecting file could not keep
both bodies in sight all the time—for example, on a
winding road or in hilly country. What does he do
in that case?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Under those circumstances the
commander of the advance party would have to send
out a sufficient number of men for this duty, so as to
insure communication being kept up at all times. It
is simply a problem to be solved by the advance party
commander. Captain Hastings, proceed with your
discussion.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Next comes the advance party
composed of the first platoon, less one squad and
connecting file, commanded by Lieutenant W. It is
marching with a column of files on each side of the
road at easy marching distances. The connecting
files between the advance party and support march
so that they can keep both bodies in communication
with each other all the time. The distance between
the advance party and support is about 400 yards.
Now comes the support, composed of the company,
less the first platoon and connecting files with the advance
party, which marches in a column of squads on
the road. Following is the main body of the battalion,
at a distance of about 500 yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, what provisions
are made for flank protection?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I do not think that any flank
protection is necessary at this time. No considerable
body of the enemy will get between our column and
the main body of our brigade. If they did they
would be doomed to destruction. On the other flank
the country is open, so that no patrols are needed in
that direction. I do not believe in wearing men out
on flank patrol duty when there is no necessity for
it.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “That is exactly the point that I
wanted to bring out. There is no necessity for wearing
men out on flank patrol duty beating their way
over rough country and climbing fences, when they
accomplish no useful purpose. Never send out a
flank patrol unless there is some sound tactical
reason for it. Then when the time comes and there is
necessity for patrols, your men will be found ready
to put forth superhuman efforts, if need be, to help
you accomplish your mission. If you are in contact
with the enemy, or there is immediate danger of such
contact, flank patrols may be necessary and a commander
should not hesitate to send them out. On the
solution of these small tactical problems, that confront
a commander in actual service, will determine
your success or failure as a leader. You must ever
keep in mind that it is a combination of these small
tactical situations that go to make up the big military
operations on which the fate of a nation may depend.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to make a rough sketch of the road occupied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the advance guard and show on it the dispositions of
the advance guard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some 10 or 15 minutes should be allowed for this.
After the sketches are completed they should be collected
and passed back to the members of the class—taking
care to see that no man gets his own solution
back again. The members of the class should be invited
to make any criticism of the sketch he has in
his possession and following this the next situation
should be proceeded with.</p>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the point selected for
the next tactical situation. This should be several
hundred yards in advance of the point where Situation
No. 3 was staged. The slips bearing Situation
No. 4 are passed out to members of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant Roberts, have arrived at this point.
The two leading men of the point (Crane and Hanson)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>are about 25 yards ahead of you. The remaining
members of the point are on the road behind you.
At this moment both Crane and Hanson take cover
and point in the direction of ——. You join them
and observe about a squad of the enemy on foot
(<i>moving around in the woods—describe just what the
enemy is doing</i>). They apparently have just arrived
and have not seen you. Several horses are being led
to the rear.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you, Sergeant Roberts, do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the situation aloud and points
out the location of the enemy.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to consider himself as being Sergeant Roberts.
The incidents contained in the situation have transpired
just as indicated. You were marching along
the road; you saw Crane and Hanson take cover and
point in the direction of the enemy; you joined them
here; you see the enemy (<i>explain what the enemy is
doing</i>). It is now up to you to make a decision as to
what you are going to do and proceed to do it. Before
going into the solution of the problem I want to
make a few remarks on the conduct of the operations
of a point.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The real work of the advance guard begins when
it gets in contact with the enemy. All formation and
all operations are designed to insure success when
this event happens. The point is the first element that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>meets the enemy and success or failure may depend
upon what is done by this small body. The big idea
is that we must get the jump on the enemy. We must
lead and make him follow. In other words, we must
take the offensive for it is only by offensive action
that military success is gained.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The commander of the point of an advance guard
must be on the lookout for the enemy all the time. He
must continually look ahead and dope out what he is
going to do if the enemy should suddenly appear in
this or that place.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sergeant Roberts has been doing this very thing
and the proper action is plain to him. Let us see if
it is plain to you.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, when you saw
Crane and Hanson take cover, what is the first thing
you would have done?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would join Crane and Hanson
immediately just as the situation indicates.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you have done anything before
going forward?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Well, sir, I would want to see
for myself just what is going on before I took any
definite action.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you have done anything
else, Captain Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Yes, sir. I would have signaled
the rest of the point ‘DOWN’ so as to give them
warning that the enemy is in sight. I will tell Pendleton
‘Signal back. Enemy in sight,’ because Lieutenant
W will want to know immediately why the
point has halted, and this will give him the information.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Then I would go to the front and join Crane
and Hanson.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Those are the points I wanted to
bring out. You see them, Captain Harvey, do you
not?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Captain Harvey, let us take
up your solution again. Let us say that you have
joined Crane and Hanson. Just what are you going
to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would open fire on the enemy
immediately. Then get the rest of the point up and
have them join in the firing.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you agree with that procedure,
Captain Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Not entirely, sir. I appreciate
the necessity for opening fire right away so as to get
the jump on the enemy, but I think we should get as
many rifles up as possible before opening fire and
disclosing our position to the enemy. I would try
to get the whole point in position to fire before opening
up, if I could. I would first make provision for
Crane and Hanson to open fire by giving them firing
data: ‘Range: —— yards. Target: enemy at (<i>describe
location of target briefly</i>). Hold your fire.’
I would then signal the other members of the point
to come up and, as they arrive, indicate the location
of the target and announce the range to them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “That solution seems to me to be
all right if the enemy will remain inactive until all
of this is done, but suppose he does not do so. Suppose
he discovers us. Suppose he opens fire himself.
Suppose he starts to retreat. Suppose he keeps coming
along towards us.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I am coming to all of that. I
would keep the enemy under observation. If he does
anything that should cause us to open fire before all
of the squad is up, I would open up with every rifle
that is in position to fire. I would take no chances on
the enemy getting the jump on me. It will only take
a minute or two to get the men into position, and I
think I am justified in delaying that long.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “I would make mighty certain that
I did not wait too long before opening fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think Captain Jones is right in
his contentions, but I agree with Captain Hodges’ solution
to get as many men as possible up on the line
before opening fire. Of course, if the enemy does
anything that would warrant opening fire before all
the men are up, it should be done.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The advantage of waiting until all
the rifles are on the line is that, as soon as these men
are fired on, they will probably try to make their get-away.
They will furnish a target for only a few
seconds. If our point can inflict sufficient casualties,
they may fall back and abandon the attempt at further
reconnaissance, especially if they can down the
patrol leader. If the leading men of the point open
fire, by the time the last man gets up, the enemy will
be well under way and there will be no target to fire
at. If the enemy returns the fire, they at once reveal
themselves, and Sergeant Roberts will do well to be
seeking out other detachments in the vicinity. A
reconnoitering patrol does not fire on an occasion of
this kind unless it is surprised and forced to do so in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>self-defense. It has a much better chance of accomplishing
its mission of securing information by avoiding
combat. If this small body of the enemy open
fire, it may be reasonably assumed that they are being
backed up by other troops or have accomplished their
mission of finding out the strength and composition
of our forces and have turned themselves into a fighting
patrol and open fire to delay us and thus give information
to their own troops that we are advancing
in force. If they immediately try to make a get-away,
it will indicate that they are a reconnoitering patrol
and will probably try to work around to the flanks of
the column to get information of our main body. On
the other hand, they will know that we are not a
reconnoitering patrol as soon as we open fire. They
know that we are backed up by other troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You now see the elements involved in this simple
situation. You see the responsibility that devolves
upon non-commissioned officers when they are placed
in the position of Sergeant Roberts. To know what
to do and how to do it requires training and close attention
to detail. Probably any of us could blunder
through a situation of this kind, but it takes a man
trained in military tactics to make his decisions
quickly, to act upon them promptly and take advantage
of the fleeting moments to inflict damage on the
enemy. These are the things that we study to become
proficient in. These are the things that we must
teach our non-commissioned officers if we are to have
confidence in their ability to meet tactical situations
that confront them, with judgment and decision. And
there is no royal road to success along this line. The
knowledge required can be attained only by thorough
study and practice.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, suppose the
enemy does something which, in your judgment, requires
fire to be opened before the whole point is up
and in position, would you join in the firing yourself?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “No, sir. I would not. I estimate
that I would have plenty to do to direct the fire
of the other men; to search the country to see if any
other parties of the enemy were in our front, and to
keep the advance party commander advised of what
is going on at the front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barney, let us assume
that you were able to get all of the men on the line
before opening fire and were able to open as a surprise
to the enemy. He takes cover and returns the
fire. What further action would you take?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barney</i>: “I would keep on firing. I
would signal the advance party commander to send
up some reinforcements.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you agree with that solution,
Lieutenant Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “No, sir. I would go after him.
I cannot run him out of his position by fire action
alone. I would immediately start filtering my men
forward while keeping up a heavy fire with the other
man.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c026'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, give us Sergeant
Roberts’ solution to the situation.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I will signal the members of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>point ‘Down,’ and tell Pendleton to signal the advance
party commander ‘Enemy in sight.’ I will
then join Crane and Hanson. I will locate the enemy,
give Crane and Hanson firing data and order
them to hold their fire. I will signal the other members
of the point to come up, and as they arrive on
the line I will give them the range and indicate the
target. When all are ready I will open fire on the
enemy. Should the enemy do anything to warrant it
I will open fire immediately, with all the rifles on the
line. I will search the landscape for other parties of
the enemy. As soon as I open fire I will take steps
to advance and close with the enemy and drive him
off.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c026'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The Director now passes out slips, bearing Situation
No. 5, to the members of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 5</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>When the point opened fire the enemy retreated
under cover of the woods (or such cover as is actually
available). They did not return the fire. You,
Sergeant Roberts, observe two riderless horses galloping
through the woods.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>When the members of the class have had a chance
to get their bearings the Director reads the situation
aloud and points out the direction in which the enemy
retreated and where the riderless horses are at this
time.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what is your
estimate of the enemy?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I should say he forms a reconnoitering
patrol sent out to secure information
about our movements. He has not yet gained the
information he desires or he would have given us a
fight. Again, had he been the advance element of a
larger body he would have engaged our point and by
now we would begin to see evidences of the troops
following him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Is there any member of the class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>who does not agree with the views just expressed?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I agree with them in the main,
but it seems to me that the enemy would have opened
fire if for no other purpose than to make trouble for
us and cause delay to our troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We must always give the enemy
credit for being up to his job. The moment we opened
fire the leader of that patrol knew that he had
encountered a fighting element of our forces. If he
stops to engage in a fight, he knows that every minute
that passes makes it just that much more difficult for
him to make his get-away. He knows that we are
going to close on him right away and he will not get
the information he has been sent out to secure. You
must always remember that a reconnoitering patrol
does not fight except when it is forced to do so in
self-defense, or when it has secured all the information
it wants, has sent it back, and then turns itself
into a fighting patrol to delay the advance of the
enemy. Are there any other points to bring up about
the mission of the enemy?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Wallace, you are assumed to be Sergeant
Roberts. What do you do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would form up my point
in the original order of march and move out along
the road. We would take up the double-time until
we get our proper distance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you do anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would send two members
of the point out to the place where the enemy was to
see if we could get an identification.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Do you agree with that procedure,
Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “Our battalion commander
would want an identification if it is possible to get
one, and it seems to me that something should be
done at once to secure it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I agree with you entirely that an
identification is desirable, but it is not the job of the
point to get it. Members of the point do not go off
on excursions to the flank. They keep plugging along
on the line of march. If flank patrols are to be sent
out, they must come from the advance party or the
support. I cannot conceive of any circumstances
that would warrant sending two members of the point
off on patrol duty. Now, Lieutenant Ralston, assuming
that it is desirable to get an identification, what
would you, as point commander, do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would send a message back
to Lieutenant Wallace, who is with the advance
party.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “By whom would you send this message?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “By Private Bailey, the rear
man of the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now state the exact message that
you would send back.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would fall back to where
Bailey is marching. I would say to him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Bailey, you go back to Lieutenant Wallace. Tell
him that we fired on an enemy reconnoitering patrol of
about one squad. Show him where they were. Tell him
that they did not return the fire. That when we opened
fire they withdrew. That there are probably two dead
or wounded men in the woods. Rejoin the point when
you can.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“I would then double-time up to the point. As I
pass Corporal Smith I would say: ‘Watch for signals
from the advance party.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “That solution seems to be all
right, but don’t you think Lieutenant Wallace would
come forward to the point when it halted? In that
case he would know all about the situation, and it
would not be necessary to send the message back to
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I am very glad you brought up that
point, Captain Harvey. No; I do not think Lieutenant
Wallace would leave his advance party at such
a critical moment. In my opinion it would be absolutely
wrong if he did. In the first place, he has no
business up with the point. Sergeant Roberts is
either capable of handling it or he is not so. If he
is, he should be let alone to solve his own problem; if
he is not capable, he should be relieved. On advance
guard duty the commander of each element will have
plenty to do if he sticks to his own job and does not
go molesting that of someone else.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class should now be conducted 200 or 300 yards
farther along the road. It is here halted and the
Director states: The point has now gotten into formation
and is continuing the advance. A message
has been sent back to the advance party commander
as indicated in our solution a few minutes ago. At
this moment you see about six mounted men of the
enemy off in that direction (points out the location
toward the flank).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, how do you size
up the situation now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I estimate that the mounted
men are the survivors of the patrol that we fired on.
They are working around to the flank of the column
to secure information of the strength and composition
of our main body. Having this information, it
is my job to get it back to the advance party commander
as soon as possible in order that proper measures
may be taken to beat off the enemy patrol and
keep him from getting the information he wants. I
would send a verbal message back by Alley, who is
marching just behind me in the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, let us assume that I am Private
Alley. Give me the message that you would
send back.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would fall back to where Alley
is marching, and as we walk along say to him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You see those mounted men over there? They are
the patrol we fired on. Go back to Lieutenant W and
show him where you saw them. Tell him they are working
around our flank to get in touch with the main body.
Come back to the point when you can.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that will cover the situation.
Are there any questions?”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 6</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant W, with the advance party, have
arrived at this point. Private Alley comes to you
with a message from Sergeant Roberts and points
out the place where the enemy was a few minutes ago.
You already have the message from Sergeant
Roberts delivered by Private Bailey.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Lieutenant W, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the situation and explains that
each member of the class is to now consider himself
as being Lieutenant W.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Jones, what would you do
under the circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span><i>Captain Jones</i>: “In the first place, the enemy’s
patrol is trying to work around our flank to get in
touch with our main body. The question to my mind
is: Is it the job of the advance party to try and prevent
this? We can hardly be expected to send patrols
from the advance party so far afield. It will
require a patrol of at least a squad, and probably two
of them, to accomplish such a mission. It would
seem to me that the task should be left to the support.
I would, therefore, get word back to the advance
guard commander of what is going on and he would
send out the necessary patrols. In the next place,
it will be necessary to investigate the place where the
enemy was when our point fired on him and secure
an identification if possible. This is close-in reconnaissance
and may be undertaken by the advance
party. I would send a patrol of three men under a
corporal for the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How would you get the message
back to Captain A?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Private Alley has been with the
point. He has seen all that has taken place up there.
I would send him back with the message to Captain
A. In order that Sergeant Roberts may know what
action is being taken I would send Bailey to him
with a message.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “Would you make these written or
verbal messages?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “They would be verbal messages.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “This is a point I want to bring out.
The platoon commander will seldom have time to
write messages. He must depend upon his men, and
especially his runners, to see for themselves what is
going on so that when it is desired to send information
back all the platoon commander has to do is to
turn to one of his runners, give him a few words of a
message, and the runner is off to make his report.
He will not only carry the message, but he will give
accurate information of what is going on. The careful
training of runners will repay the trouble in large
dividends when the time comes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the present situation I think it would be well
for Lieutenant F to send one of his trained runners
back to the captain with Private Bailey so that he
can hear the captain’s orders and see just what he
does to meet the situation. The runners will then
return to Lieutenant W and tell him about it.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Captain Hodges, let us assume
that you are going to send Private Alley back
with the message; just what instructions would you
give him?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would say to Private Alley:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You go back to the captain. Repeat your message
to him. Tell him about what happened at the point during
the halt. Tell him I am sending a patrol to investigate
the place where the enemy was fired on.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would adopt the Director’s suggestion and send
one of my runners with Private Alley. I would say
to him:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“‘You go with Private Alley to the captain. See
what he does to meet the situation, hear his orders, and
bring back information of all this to me.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That appears to cover the situation
very well. Lieutenant Baker, what message would
you send to Sergeant Roberts?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I would say to Private Bailey,
who was present when I gave Private Alley his instructions:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Go to Sergeant Roberts and tell him what I have
done to meet the situation.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us assume that you have selected
Corporal Jansen as the patrol commander to
investigate the place where the enemy was fired on.
Corporal Jansen has reported to you. What orders
do you give him, Captain Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “As we march along I would say to
Corporal Jansen:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You have heard the message just brought back by
Private Bailey. Take the front rank of your squad and
reconnoiter the edge of that wood (pointing). An enemy
identification is especially desired. Report the
facts to the battalion commander when he comes up.
Rejoin the advance party when you can.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think these orders cover the situation
admirably. I hope you all now appreciate the
multitude of little problems that come up for solution
in the course of a tour of advance guard duty.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted along the route of
march, for a distance of several hundred yards, to a
place where entirely new terrain is available and
where the lay of the land is such that a march outpost
may be established.</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is halted and the Director passes out the
slips bearing Situation No. 7.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 7</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>It is assumed that the advance guard has been
marching for two hours since the march was resumed
after the enemy patrol was encountered. During this
time enemy scouts have been observed from time to
time, but they have not attempted to interfere with
the march of the column.</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain A, are marching at the head of the
support. When you arrive at this point the signal
“HALT” is received from the rear. You halt and
relay the signal forward. A moment later the battalion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>adjutant joins you and states: “The column
will halt for one hour. The major directs that the
advance guard provide for the security of the command
for that time.”</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Captain A, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the situation aloud and makes
any explanation that may appear to him to be
necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “When a column on the march halts
for any considerable length of time the advance guard
continues its covering duty by forming march outposts.
These are simply patrols sent out to the front
and flanks, a certain distance, where they halt and
remain there until ordered to continue the march or
until they are recalled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The advance party usually furnishes these patrols
which are sent out on the routes by which the enemy
may approach. The support is posted at some central
point from which it may readily reinforce any
group that may be threatened by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a situation like this the question always comes
up as to how the advance guard commander will issue
his orders for the establishment of the march outposts—that
is, whether he will do it by a message to
the several elements or whether he will issue an order
and have copies made and sent out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the message system is employed, the advance
guard commander will have to include the new information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of the enemy and our own troops and give the
order to the element. All of this is accomplished by
issuing a simple five paragraph order and sending it
out. This is more expeditious than message writing.
The commander has all the information he requires,
and he is given definite instructions as to what he,
himself, is to do. The order method is favored.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, how do you size up
the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The mission of the advance guard
now is to continue to provide protection to the main
body by establishing a march outpost. Enemy scouts
have been observed from time to time, but they have
not interfered with the march. We have no information
regarding any considerable force of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our main body is halted and will remain so for
at least an hour. Our advance guard is so disposed
that it will be able to take up its new formation without
confusion. The advance party can cover the
main road and, in general, the head of the column.
Our patrols, of which I assume there are two on the
exposed flank, will form march outguards and protect
that flank. I would send out another patrol of
one squad to cover the other flank and prevent enemy
scouts from working around there and observing the
main body.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My decision is to form a march outpost.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What Captain Hall has said constitutes
Captain A’s ‘Estimate of the Situation.’
These are the points that would flash through his
mind as soon as he gets the information that the halt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>is to be made. Lieutenant Barry, what is now necessary
to put the decision into effect?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “It is necessary to issue an
order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How would you go about this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would assemble the two platoon
commanders, the platoon sergeants and the first
sergeant, and have them write down my order in
their message books. This would give me a sufficient
number of copies for all purposes.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “This shows the necessity for a company
commander having some means whereby several
copies of an order may be made by a duplicating
process—carbon paper. I believe the plan of having
the first sergeant or a clerk carry a duplicating book
would solve the problem. Now, Lieutenant Hunt,
you may dictate Captain A’s order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “In order to save a repetition
and at the same time let all of the company with the
support know what is going on I would have the men
give me their attention. My order would be:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘There is no further information of the enemy. Our
battalion halts for one hour.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The advance guard will establish march outposts.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The advance party will be posted on the main road
and cover the head of the column.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The two flank patrols on the —— flank will be
posted as march outguards and cover that flank.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Sergeant Hamilton with the Fourth Squad, 2nd Platoon,
will establish a march outguard on the —— flank
in the vicinity (point out location) and cover the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>—— flank of the column. The support will be posted
here.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to Support.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to cover the situation.
Now, how would you get this order out to all the
people to whom it should go?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would send it to Lieutenant
W by a runner. I would send it out to the flank patrols
by the section guide of the 3rd Platoon and direct
him to make an inspection of the dispositions
out there so as to make sure they are in position to
carry out their mission. I would send it to the battalion
commander by a runner.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “So much for the distribution of the
order. What would you do now, Lieutenant Barry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would now see that Sergeant
Hamilton gets started on his mission, and then I
would post sentinels at the support to watch out for
signals from the various detachments that are out.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I believe that would meet the situation
very well.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before terminating this Terrain
Exercise I want to invite the attention of the members
of the class to the multitude of small details that
infantry commanders have to attend to in a problem
so simple as the one we have had under consideration
today. Let us suppose we have an active and aggressive
enemy opposing our advance, and you can
see how these details would multiply. The point I
want to bring up is that, unless officers and non-commissioned
officers prepare themselves for this duty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>by study and practice, they have not a chance of being
able to meet these problems intelligently in active
service. You must know what to do under any given
situation, and you must know how to go about doing
it. The commander who hesitates, gives his orders
and then changes them several times, soon loses the
confidence of his men and will eventually find himself
replaced by another man who has taken advantage of
his opportunities to learn the game and has the ability
to carry it out. The best way I know of to acquire
this knowledge is by actual practice along the lines
that we have gone today.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>Special Situation—Blue</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>A regiment of Blue infantry, operating in hostile
country, is marching on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road, towards
(<i>c</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The support of the advance guard, composed of
Companies A and B (less 1 platoon, Company B),
is this time at (<i>d</i>). The reserve, consisting of the remainder
of the battalion, is following at a distance of
about 400 yards and the main body follows the reserve
at a distance of 500 yards.</p>

<p class='c010'>A (<i>e</i>) flank guard, consisting of the 3rd platoon,
Company B, has arrived at this point (<i>f</i>) marching
on the (<i>g</i>)-(<i>h</i>) road.</p>

<p class='c010'>A force of the enemy is reported in the vicinity of
(<i>i</i>) and detachments of mounted men have been operating
in the direction of (<i>j</i>).</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant A, commanding the (<i>e</i>) flank
guard, and marching at the head of the main body of
your command, have arrived at this point (<i>f</i>).</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What is the formation of your (<i>e</i>) flank guard at

</div>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) The road on which the Blue regiment is
marching. In military orders and problems roads
are designated by naming places located on them.
For example, the Longs-Emmitsburg-Fairplay road
would mean the main road passing through these
places. When military maps are made all cross-roads
and road-forks should be numbered and all
hills and other prominent topographical features
either designated by their local names or given letter
designations. This will greatly facilitate their designation
in orders and messages. When maps have
grid lines on them the location of points may be designated
by the use of coordinates.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) Some point, a number of miles distant, in the
direction in which the troops are marching.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) The point on the main road where the support
of the advance guard of the column has arrived. It
should be about abreast of (<i>f</i>), (see below).</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>e</i>) The designation of the flank guard, right or
left.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>f</i>) The point at which the flank guard is supposed
to have arrived. The point where the Terrain Exercise
is to begin.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>g</i>)-(<i>h</i>) The road on which it is intended that the
flank guard is to march and along which the Terrain
Exercise is to be conducted. This road should lie approximately
parallel to and not more than a mile distant
from the road on which the main body is marching.
If no such network of roads exist, the Director
may explain to the class the conditions and assume
that the nearest road is about a mile distant and
work out the problem on that assumption. This procedure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>strains the situation a little and robs it of
some of its reality. The members of the class will
have to make the best of it and will have to draw
upon their imagination to picture it.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>i</i>) A locality some miles distant in the direction
of which the Blue force is marching.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>j</i>) Localities or places some distance to the flank
of the Blue force and in the direction of the road on
which the flank guard is marching.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are conducted to (<i>f</i>)

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the sheets containing the

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going ahead with this exercise
I want to make a few remarks about a flank
guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ordinarily the flanks of a column on the march
may be protected by small patrols sent out from time
to time from the advance guard. There are occasions,
however, when patrols will not suffice, as in the
present situation, where it is known that hostile
troops are operating on the flank of our line of march.
In this case it is necessary to send out a stronger detachment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to march parallel to the route of the main
body. This detachment is denominated a <i>Flank
Guard</i> and is an element in the system of covering
troops provided for the protection of a marching
column.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The flank guard marches abreast of the column
and assumes the general formation of an advance
guard, having a point thrown out to the front, followed
by the remainder of the detachment, much as
an advance party and support. Patrols are sent out
to the exposed flank whenever necessary, and communication
is maintained with the main body by means
of small patrols or connecting files. In some cases it
may be necessary to detach a small rear guard, as in
the case where a flank guard has been attacked by a
comparatively large force of the enemy and has taken
up a position to hold them off until the main body can
pass the danger point and the flank guard resume its
march.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general duties of the flank guard are much
the same as those of an advance guard; that is, to do
everything possible to provide for the uninterrupted
progress of the main body. All other duties are incidental
to this and all have this prime object in
view.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, into what
parts is your flank guard divided at this time?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would have an advance
party and a support. Each element would consist of
one section of three squads each. From the advance
party a point consisting of one squad would be sent
to the front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Had you thought of a formation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>which the whole platoon is kept intact as one body
with only a point of one squad out in front?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Yes, sir. I had considered
that possible formation and abandoned the idea because
we can cover more road space with the formation
that I have adopted and the more road space the
flank guard can cover without undue dispersion the
more of the column of the main body it covers and
protects.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Now let us assume that
we adopt your formation of an advance party with a
squad as point and the second section as a support.
What is the formation of your point, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “It would be in the ‘Boni
Point’ formation, the men marching on alternate
sides of the road with a distance of about 20 yards
between them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that formation would be
just right for this occasion. What is the next element
of the flank guard?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “The connecting files, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How many of them?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would have two at least.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Wouldn’t one man be sufficient as
a connecting file?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “At this particular point one
man would, but there are places on this road where
one man would not be able to keep up the communication,
and to make sure of that being done all the
time I would detail two men. The duty is no more
arduous than marching with the point or the advance
party, and I do not consider that it is any hardship.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, what would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>be the distance from the rear man of the point to the
head of the advance party?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “About two hundred yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would be the distance from
the advance party to the head of the support?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would have that about
350 yards.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You will want to keep in communication
with the main body on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road. How
would you accomplish that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would send out two men to
march so that they can see the main body and the
flank guard. I realize that they cannot do this all
the time but they will be able to do it at sufficiently
frequent intervals to keep both bodies informed if
anything unusual happens.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you have a patrol out on the
exposed flank at this time?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The answer to this question will depend upon the lay
of the country on the exposed flank. If it is close, a patrol will
be necessary. If it is open to the limit of effective rifle fire a
patrol would not be necessary. In any event, the Director
should bring out the principles stated below, at some point in
the Terrain Exercise.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; I do not see the necessity for a patrol on
the exposed flank at the present. We can see all the
country to the limit of effective rifle range from the
road, and I think a patrol there would be a waste of
men. If, later on, the topography should demand it,
I would send out such patrols as may be necessary.
At what distance they would march from the column
cannot be stated. It would depend entirely upon the
country. They would have to go out far enough to
see something more than can be seen from the road,
if they are to be of any use.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span><i>The Director</i>: “You are exactly right. I think all
the members of the class will agree with you. There
is no necessity for wearing men out on flank patrol
duty, beating their way over rough country and
climbing fences, when they accomplish no useful
purpose. Never order a disposition unless there is a
sound tactical reason for it. Then when the time
comes your men are ready to put forth superhuman
efforts, if need be, to help you accomplish your mission.
On the solution of these small problems in
actual service rests your success or failure as a tactical
leader of men. You must remember that it is
the combination of these small tactical situations that
go to make up the big maneuvers.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would be the march formation
of the support, Lieutenant Ralston.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would have three squads
in the support. I would have them march with a column
of files on each side of the road. I would have
two squads on this side of the road towards the enemy
and one squad on the other side.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What are the advantages of this
formation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “It makes easier marching
than in a column of squads; the column is not so vulnerable
to enemy fire; if a deployment to the front is
necessary it may readily be effected by deploying the
leading squad of each column to the right and left
respectively and deploying the rear squad of the
column towards the enemy in rear of them. If a deployment
to the flank towards the enemy is necessary
it is practically already made for we have two squads
on that flank now, and all the men will have to do is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>get a little more interval, the squad on the side of the
road away from the enemy will get their proper interval
and are in the right position for a small reserve;
and deployments can be made without any
confusion in case of sudden attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we can all agree that you
have the proper formation. Now, I want each member
of the class to draw a rough sketch of the road at
this point and show on it the detailed formation of
the flank guard. Make the scale large so you can
show the details.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>When the sketches are completed the Director distributes
a mimeographed sketch showing the disposition
of the flank guard in order that the members
of the class may compare their sketches with it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The class is conducted along the road on which the
flank guard is supposed to be marching to the point
where a road leading from the flank where the enemy
is reported, enters it. It may be assumed that the
flank guard has marched a mile or more to reach this
point.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the sheets bearing Situation
No. 2, to the members of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant A, commanding the flank guard,
and marching at the head of the support, are approaching
this road fork. The flank guard is now
marching abreast of the interval between the reserve
of the advance guard and the head of the main body
of the column on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road. There has been
no contact with the enemy.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads over the problem and makes
such explanation as may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, how do you size
up the situation at this time?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “The mission of the flank guard
is the protection of this flank of the column marching
on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road, and provide for its uninterrupted
progress. The enemy has been reported out
on this flank (<i>pointing</i>). He will naturally take advantage
of roads leading towards the Blue column to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>facilitate his operations. The road we are approaching
leads from the direction of the enemy and must
be watched until our main column has passed the
danger point. We are marching abreast of the interval
between the advance guard and the main body
of our main column. This road will have to be
watched until the main body passes beyond it. The
road space occupied by the main body of the column
would be about 2,900 yards, including field train of
the regiment and excluding the combat train of the
1st brigade. The column will pass a given point at
the rate of about 88 yards per minute. It will therefore
take about 32 minutes for the main body to pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My decision would be to send a patrol out on the
road to the —— (direction).”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Your estimate seems to cover the
necessary points and I think we can agree that you
have arrived at the proper decision. Just a mention
of this ‘Estimate of the Situation.’ It is a logical
process of thought involving the elements just mentioned
by Captain Harvey, terminating in a tactical
decision. This is what you have to do in the solution
of all tactical problems. The patrol leader does it in
every move of his patrol. The platoon as a flank
guard requires the same process on the part of the
platoon leader. The company commander, as commander
of the advance party of an advance guard,
must consider these same elements in the conduct of
his covering detachment. It is the same with the battalion
commander, the regimental commander, and
on up to the commander of a division. When you are
presented with a tactical situation for solution, figure
out all the elements of it; your mission, your situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>with respect to the enemy, the influence of the
terrain, and then arrive at a clean-cut decision as to
what you are going to do. Captain Hodges, what
would be the strength of the patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would make it one squad. I
think that would be about right.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Whom would you detail in charge
of the patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Sergeant Wilkins, the left
guide of the platoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “When would you issue your orders
for the patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “As we march along I will call
Sergeant Wilkins to the head of the support and give
him his orders as we march along. That would do
away with the necessity for halting the column while
I am giving the orders.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Captain James, tell us just
how you would give the orders to the patrol and just
what you would say.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “As we approach the cross-road I
will call Sergeant Wilkins to join me. As we march
along I will give him the orders for the patrol:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘We have not heard or seen anything of the enemy.
Our flank guard is now marching abreast of the distance
between the advance guard and main body of our column
on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You will take the sixth squad and patrol down the
road we are approaching to the (direction) to cover the
passage of the main body. Remain out about 35 minutes
and then return. Catch up with the flank guard when
you can.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to head of support.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to cover the situation
very well.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “It seems to me that if I were
Sergeant Wilkins I would want you to indicate how
far I am to go with the patrol. Can the Director enlighten
us on that point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, what do you think
about the point that Lieutenant Baker brings up?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “Captain James told the Sergeant
to stay out about 35 minutes. It seems to me that is
sufficient. The Sergeant can keep tab on his time and
judge his distance by that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes, I think the time element is one
thing, but there is another point that has not been
mentioned. You do not want to hamper your subordinate
with detailed instructions. It may be that
there is a point on this road only a short distance out
where Sergeant Wilkins has a good view over the
country and a good position in case the enemy does
come upon him. There would be no necessity for
going on beyond such a point. If he had specific
orders to go a certain distance he would feel that he
had to do it. You give the Sergeant his mission,
make him understand what he is out there for. Tell
him about how long he is to remain out and then let
him work out his own problem. You must not go into
details. The moment you do so you get beyond your
depth. You cannot foresee all contingencies. There
has been only one military commander that was able
to do this. He was the great Napoleon.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “It is realized that it is probable
that no member of this class will ever be called upon
to actually conduct the operation of a small patrol
such as we have here. It is, however, necessary for
you to have a knowledge of just what is likely to happen
to any patrol that you may have occasion to send
out from a covering detachment of which you may be
in command. It shows you the problem that may be
put up to non-commissioned officers for solution and
indicates in a most practical manner the necessity
for their training and instruction.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, let us assume
that you are Sergeant Wilkins. Just what would
you do on receipt of the platoon commander’s
order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would step aside and as the
sixth squad comes up I join it, marching abreast of
the squad leader. As we get to the cross road I look
at my watch to get the time. When the head of the
squad reaches the cross-road I command:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Sixth squad, FOLLOW ME.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I conduct the squad down the cross-road for a few
yards and then command:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, we have the
squad halted near the cross-road here where Lieutenant
Barry has conducted it. Let us assume you have
sized up the situation and are ready to issue your
verbal orders to the squad. Just what would you
say? I want you to give the exact words.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘We have seen or heard nothing of the enemy. Our
main column continues the march on the (<i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Our flank guard is now marching abreast of the distance

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Are there any comments on the
order as given by Lieutenant Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “It seems to me that it
would be well to follow the Lieutenant’s order and
tell the men how long we are going to stay out.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt will you please
answer that comment?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I do not calculate that it makes
any difference to the men of the squad. They should
be told what they are going out for so that they may
know the purpose of the patrol. But as for their having
any information as to how long they are to stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>out, I do not think it has a place in the order. That
part of the order was only for Sergeant Wilkins.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. The Lieutenant
made a mental calculation of the time that it
would take the main body to pass the danger point
and specified that 35 minutes as the time the patrol
should stay out. I do not think that is any concern of
the men. Sergeant Wilkins might well tell it to Corporal
Jenkins so if anything should happen to him
he would know the orders. Any further comment?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Does the Director think
that it would be proper to halt the squad to give them
the orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes, I think that was the proper
procedure. It is highly important that every man of
the squad know what they are going out for. Time is
not a specially important factor just now. Then, too,
the squad must be gotten into patrol formation. I
think time is saved by taking a minute or two to issue
the orders and make sure that every man understands
the mission. The men can then go about the
work so much more intelligently.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant Wilkins, have arrived at this point.
Your patrol is in the formation originally adopted.
Nothing has yet been seen or heard of the enemy.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, you have arrived
at a point which is sufficiently far out on the
road to prevent the enemy from firing into the main
body. You have here very good observation over the
country to your front and flanks. You have a fairly
good field of fire. As you know, only cavalry has
been reported operating on this flank and on account
of obstacles, wire fences, etc., their operations will
be confined more or less to the roads. After considering
all of these facts what is your reaction?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I can see no necessity for going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>further. I do not think anything more could be
accomplished by doing so. From a position here we
could certainly stop any small body and we could
administer considerable punishment to a body as
large as a troop if we caught them mounted on the
road. I would take up a position here and make my
disposition so as to cover the road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Having decided to take up a position
in this vicinity, just how would you do it, Lieutenant
Wallace, where would you place your men?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “There is sufficient space on
the road and at the sides of the road to accommodate
the squad. I think I would place them so they can
fire straight down the road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What do you think of that solution,
Lieutenant Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would not do it that way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “Well, sir, the men would be
too much exposed. Suppose the enemy appeared on
the road with as much as a troop. We fire into him.
Perhaps the hostile captain’s orders are to check the
advance of our main body. He decides to take his
losses and charges down the road. Our small detachment
would be in a precarious situation, only eight
men against an entire troop. The men know they
have no means of getting out of the way. They
would be thinking more of their own safety than of
hitting the enemy. They would shoot wild, and the
chances are that the squad would be ridden down and
destroyed. On the other hand, if we put the men on
the other side of the wire fences, they will know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>a mounted charge cannot hurt them. They will have
more confidence in their ability to stop it and the
firing will be much more effective.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Then you would place your men on
the other side of the fence, would you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “On which side of the road would
you place them?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “On both sides, sir. Half a
squad on each side. This disposition would give me
a good cross-fire on the road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Have you any objections to that
disposition, Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Yes, sir. It divides the force
and makes it very difficult for Sergeant Wilkins to
control and direct the fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, do you see any
other objections?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Yes, sir. I would not only want
all the men on the same side of the road but I would
want them on this side (indicating the side in the direction
of which the flank guard is marching). If it
comes to the point where we are compelled to fall
back we can do so directly on our own troops and not
have to expose ourselves while climbing the fences
and crossing the road. And the field of fire is about
as good on this favorable side, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think your points are well taken.
Let us decide that we are to place the patrol in position
on this side (indicate) of the road. Captain
James just how would you go about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would get the men through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>fence, and to the vicinity of the position that we are
to take up.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

where the position is to be taken up.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain James, let us assume that
you have gotten your squad here. Tell us just what
orders you would give?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘There is no further information of the enemy. Our
troops continue the march.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘We will take up a position here.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that would cover the situation

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “No, sir, I would stay right here.
If anything happens I want to be here to direct my
men. If I considered a flank reconnaissance necessary
I would send Corporal Jenkins to make it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is assumed that the patrol has taken up a position
on the side of the road towards which the flank

<p class='c010'>The Director will indicate the exact position of

<p class='c010'>The Director will now distribute the sheets bearing
Situation No. 5 to the class and make such explanations
as may be necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 5</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The patrol has occupied a position at this point.
At this moment you, Sergeant Wilkins, observe a
party of enemy cavalry approaching along the road
at a trot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two troopers are in the lead; at a distance of about
75 yards two more follow; about 150 yards in rear
there are four more troopers with short distances between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>them. Apparently they have not observed
your patrol.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will point out to the members of the
class the position of each of the troopers at the moment.
They should be far enough away to allow the
orders of Sergeant Wilkins to be given.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, what class of
cavalry detachment do you estimate this to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I should say it is a contact patrol
sent out from a larger body to reconnoiter. If
it were the point of an advance guard we would now
be seeing other troops farther to the rear of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I would open fire on the cavalrymen.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “When would you open fire?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “There are only eight of them.
We have an ambuscade and ought to be able to bring
down practically all of them. There would be no
danger in letting them come close up.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How close would you let them
come?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “Well, sir, I would let the leading
men come within 50 yards, if they would do so,
before opening fire. The man farthest away would
then be about 450 yards distant. I would assign a
target to each man beginning at the right man taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the rear trooper and so on through the squad to the
left. I would make it my particular business to see
that no man passed this point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Just what orders would you give?
I want you to state the exact words that you would
employ in meeting the situation.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “As soon as I determine how
close I am going to let the enemy come before opening
fire I will order:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Four men on right. Range: 450 yards. Target:
Enemy cavalry on road, four men at rear of patrol. Renolds
and Shane. Range: 300 yards. Target: Enemy cavalry
on road, two men in center of patrol. Healy fire on
second man. Corporal Jenkins take the leading man.
When you get your man fire on the man next farthest
away. Wait for my command to open fire.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘When the enemy patrol has advanced to the point
where I have indicated the ranges I will command:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Fire at will.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us assume that the patrol came
up the road and that you opened fire in accordance
with your orders. The two leading men and one of
the next group of two were brought down and one
of the latter made his get-away. At least two of the
last group were brought down. You have then inflicted
five casualties on the patrol and the three remaining
men got away. Now, Lieutenant A will hear
the firing and will want to know what it is all about.
How would you meet this requirement, Captain
Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The action will be over in a minute.
I would want to get an identification as soon as possible.
I would say to Corporal Jenkins:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“‘Go out to the leading trooper we brought down and
see if you can get an identification.’</p>

<p class='c018'>While Corporal Jenkins is doing this I will call Halley,
who is the expert semaphore man to me and say
to him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Go back to the cross-roads and signal Lieutenant A:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘“Eight men, Sixth Cavalry fired on, disabled five of
them, three got away.” Bring me any message that Lieutenant
A may send.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I would assume that Corporal Jenkins secured an
identification on the leading cavalryman. If he did
not the message would be modified accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I do not understand why we
go to so much trouble at this particular time to get
an identification.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Suppose you were commanding the
Blue force and you ran into the enemy in this locality.
Cavalry troops are operating on your front
and flanks. If the advance guard picks up an identification
of the 6th Cavalry in its front, the flank
guard does the same and we get our identification
here. This information put together indicates to the
Blue command that he is being opposed by a single
regiment of cavalry and considering the front he is
covering he cannot be very strong at any point. But
suppose the identification of three different regiments
are picked up. This puts a different aspect on the
situation. Our commander would estimate that he
is probably confronted by a cavalry division and his
plans would have to be made accordingly. Make it a
general rule that you secure an enemy identification
when it is possible to do so. It may have little value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>at the time and again it may be most valuable. You
play safe by getting it and sending it in.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I see the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, there are five
dead or wounded men of the enemy lying out there in
the road. Would you do anything about them?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “Except to secure the identification,
I would not. The men of the enemy who
made their escape probably did not have a very clear
idea of where the fire came from and I would not
want to surrender any of the advantages I now possess
with respect to position and concealment. When
the enemy learns of the disaster to his patrol he may
send out a strong detachment to secure their dead
and wounded and punish us. Our own main body is
marching away from us and our position is becoming
momentarily more dangerous. I could do nothing
for the enemy wounded. They would have to stay
where they are for the time being.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “When do you estimate that you
should leave here?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “In the absence of orders or
other circumstances which I do not now see, I will
leave here when the time designated by the flank
guard commander is up.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c012'>The Director states the following situation orally:</p>

<p class='c017'>“At this moment you hear quite heavy firing which you
estimate comes from the direction of the main body.
There are a few shots from the direction of the flank
guard. The time you were ordered to remain out here
is about up.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, how do you
size up the situation now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Our original mission was
to cover this road for a certain number of minutes.
That time is about up now when we will have completed
the mission. New conditions have arisen
which could not have been provided for when Lieutenant
A gave us our original orders and a new situation
confronts us. It would seem to me that our
mission would now be to ‘continue to cover the
road.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the firing we have heard, it is possible that
our main body has run into a considerable force of
the enemy on the main road. If this is a Cavalry
force covering one of Infantry it will soon transfer
its activities to the flanks and try and cut in on the
flanks of our main body. Under those circumstances
our flank guard will have a very important role to
play. The road that we are on leads directly to the
flank and rear of our main body and must be guarded
for the time being. The fact that we have already
encountered the enemy indicates that he intends to
make use of it if practicable and the presence of even
our small force here will make him more cautious
and delay and hamper his operations. If our main
body has run into only a small Cavalry force of the
enemy it will be quickly brushed aside and the situation
will be cleared up in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After considering all of these circumstances, I
think Sergeant Wilkins’ decision would be to remain
here and continue covering this road.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right. Now, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>arrived at that decision, what are you going to
do next, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “The men would be looking to
me for instructions. I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘It is apparent that our main body has encountered
a force of the enemy. It is possible that our flank guard
has halted.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘We will remain here for the present.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Shane, you will keep on the look out for the enemy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Take off your packs and put them on the ground behind
you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Secure your intrenching tools and each man improve
his firing position.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I will remain here.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that order would meet the
immediate requirements.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will bring out the points involved in
the preparation of the position for defense. This
will depend entirely upon the terrain. By questioning
members of the class and a discussion the method
of preparing certain of the individual fire positions
will be arrived at. The question of obstacles in the
road to interfere with the enemy’s advance should
also be considered and discussed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Halley returns to the patrol. He reports that he
sent the message to Lieutenant A, and that it was acknowledged.
He received the following message
from Lieutenant A for Sergeant Wilkins:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Advance guard meets strong opposition on main road—Cavalry.

  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “What action would you now take,
Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “In the first place, I would
not want Corporal Vincent’s squad to come out here
on this road. I have been thinking for some little
time about the fact that there are no troops back at
the cross-roads where we turned off from the flank
guard. The enemy finding his efforts blocked on the
roads leading toward our main body will find that
opening sooner or later. I would want Corporal
Vincent to take up a position near the cross-road
and cover the approaches from the —— (direction).
I would send Halley back to the cross-roads with a
message to Corporal Vincent to that effect.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that is a proper move on
your part. The cross-road certainly needs to be
covered. We will assume that Halley has left with
your message to Corporal Vincent. Would you take
any other action at the time?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Yes, sir. The men would
know that Halley has come back with some information.
I would give the information to the men in
order that they may know. I would tell them of
Corporal Vincent’s squad coming back to reinforce
us and inform them of what I intend to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right in giving this
information to your men. They can go about their
task more intelligently. Would you go back to the
cross-road to inspect Corporal Vincent’s position
after he had made his disposition, Lieutenant
Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “The flank guard commander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>has charged me with the defense of the cross-road.
He has given me Corporal Jenkins’ and Corporal
Vincent’s squads for the purpose. It is just as important
that I know from personal observation what
arrangements are made for the defense of the main
road as it is on this flank. I would turn over the
defense of this position to Corporal Jenkins and then
go back and inspect Corporal Vincent’s dispositions.”</p>

Terrain Exercise. Let us see what we have gotten
out of it—of what tactical benefit it has been to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first situation was devised to show you the
tactical necessity for a flank guard, the duties that
devolve upon it, and the formation that is best calculated
to enable it to carry out its functions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The second situation was devised for the purpose
of illustrating the necessity for covering approaches

which could not have been foreseen have

<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>General Situation</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The (<i>a</i>) forms the boundary between hostile states.
A Blue force is concentrating at (<i>b</i>). Red troops
have been reported in the direction of (<i>c</i>).</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Special Situation—Blue</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>A Blue detachment consisting of one regiment of
Infantry has been sent out toward the border as a
covering force. It is disposed as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>The regiment (less 2nd and 3rd Battalions) on the
(<i>d</i>) road; 2nd Battalion on the (<i>e</i>) road; 3rd Battalion
on the (<i>f</i>) road.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 2nd Battalion marching on the (<i>e</i>) road, with
Company E as advance guard, has reached (<i>g</i>),
where the battalion commander decides to halt for
the night. It is now 3 o’clock p. m. The column has
halted, and the company commanders have assembled
at this point.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battalion commander issues verbal orders as
follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Small detachments of the enemy have been reported at
(<i>h</i>) and (<i>i</i>). Our 3rd Battalion is halted for the night at
(<i>k</i>); our regiment (less 2nd and 3rd Battalions) is halted
for the night at (<i>l</i>).</p>

<p class='c017'>“This battalion halts for the night at (<i>m</i>). March conditions
cease.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“The advance guard will furnish the outpost along the
line (<i>n</i>).</p>

<p class='c017'>“The remainder of the battalion will bivouac, Company
F at (<i>o</i>); Company G at (<i>o</i>); Company H at (<i>o</i>); Headquarters
Company at (<i>o</i>). In case of attack the outpost
will be supported.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The field trains will join the troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Messages to (<i>p</i>).”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Company E is organized in accordance with T. O.
28-W. See Appendix 1.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation of Letter Symbols</h4>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>) In designating the boundary line, some natural
topographical or geographical feature should
be selected, such as a river, creek, canal, crest of a
ridge, etc. In this problem it may be assumed that
the halt of the battalion for the night is made just
within the boundary or across the boundary in enemy
territory. The choice will depend upon the location
of suitable ground for the outpost with a view to
bringing out the elements involved in the posting of
the outpost.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) A point within friendly territory. Should
be a march or two from the boundary.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) A point within enemy territory. Should be a
march or two from the boundary.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f</i>) Detachments are sent out to cover the
concentration of troops when the concentration is
made at a point where there is danger that the enemy
may attempt to interfere with it. Such detachments
proceed toward the border on the main routes by
which the enemy must advance. (<i>d</i>) Would be the
next main road to the left of the road (<i>e</i>) on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the 2nd Battalion is advancing; (<i>f</i>) would be the next
main road to the right of the road on which the 2nd
Battalion is advancing. This places the 2nd Battalion
in the center of the formation.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>g</i>) A point in the vicinity of the place where the
Terrain Exercise is to be conducted.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>h</i>) and (<i>i</i>) The places where the enemy troops are
reported to be. They should be several miles away
from (<i>g</i>), where the battalion is to halt for the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>k</i>) The place where the 3rd Battalion halts for the
night.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>l</i>) The place where the regiment (less 2nd and 3rd
Battalions) halts for the night. The three places
where the battalions halt should form a general line
covering the place where the Blue forces are concentrating.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>m</i>)   The place where our battalion bivouacs for
the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>n</i>)   Indicate the general line that the outpost is to
occupy. If it is impossible to do this it may be stated
as follows: “Covering the approaches from the

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Captain E, are in command of Company E,
which is now the advance guard, and has been designated
to form the outpost for the night. Your company
is in advance guard formation on the road.</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The action you, Captain E, take and the orders
you issue.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are assembled at (<i>m</i>)
(see explanation of symbols), where the battalion is
to halt for the night.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before taking up the problem for
solution I want to make a few remarks on the subject
of the protection of a body of troops while in bivouac,
and to review briefly the duties and formation of an
outpost.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As a command on the march protects itself from
surprise by covering detachments called advance
guards, flank guards and rear guards, so also does a
command at a halt protect itself by a system of covering
detachments denominated outposts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Duties.</i>—Like advance guards on the march, the
outpost is charged with the duties of observation and
resistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Specifically these duties are:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. To protect the main body so that the troops
may rest undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. In case of attack, to check the advance of the
enemy long enough to enable the main body to make
dispositions to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. To reconnoiter the enemy, prevent his reconnaissance
and give timely warning of the approach
of hostile bodies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Subdivisions.</i>—The outpost is divided into two
general lines. The first, which is called the ‘line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>observation,’ does the watching for the enemy and
prevents his small bodies from getting any information
about our troops or annoying them. The second
is a ‘fighting line,’ which holds off larger bodies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These lines must cover the front and flanks of the
troops at rest. The ‘watching line’ must be so located
that the watchers out in front will be able to
see the enemy before he gets close enough to do damage.
The ‘fighting line’ must be so located that it
will have what we call a ‘good field of fire;’ that is,
the ground in front must not be such that it will hide
the movements of the enemy and allow him to get
within effective rifle range without coming under our
fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Formation.</i>—The formation of an outpost may
best be described by referring to an outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hold your left hand in front of you with the
thumb and fingers extended and pointing to the
front, palm of hand down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wrist will be the location of the troops in
camp or in bivouac.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The knuckle joint of the second finger will be the
location of the reserve of the outpost. This is the
body of troops that is held out of the fight until the
direction of the enemy’s main attack is developed,
when it is thrown in to meet it, or to make what we
call a ‘counter-attack.’ In very small outposts this
reserve is usually omitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The second joints of the fingers and thumb will
mark the positions occupied by the ‘supports.’ These
are the fighting troops and they occupy the fighting
line of the outpost. From these supports, small detachments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>which we call ‘outguards,’ are sent to the
front.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first joints of the fingers and thumb will
mark the positions of the outguards. These are
classified as pickets, sentry squads and cossack posts.
A picket consists of two or more squads and is posted
so as to cover the most important route by which the
enemy may come. The sentry squad consists of one
rifle squad. The cossack post is composed of a non-commissioned
officer and three men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tips of the fingers and thumb will mark the
line of the sentinels. These are the ears and eyes
of the outpost system.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sentinels are sent out to the front from the
outguards. A picket posts one double sentinel post
for each of its squads. Each sentry squad is charged
with maintaining one double sentinel post. The
cossack post maintains a single sentinel who is
posted nearby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are there any questions?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will endeavor to answer any questions
that may be asked by the members of the class.
After all questions have been cleared up, the Director
will hand a copy of the problem to each member of
the class. A few minutes are allowed for them to
read it and get oriented.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Please give me your attention
while we go over the problem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director reads the problem aloud, each member
of the class following from the copy in his possession.
The direction of places mentioned are
pointed out.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, give a brief
statement of the tactical situation as you understand
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lieutenant Hunt states his understanding of the
tactical situation. As he proceeds, the Director
makes such explanations as may be desirable. One
or more additional members of the class may be
called upon to state their version of the situation.
All of this is for the purpose of fixing the elements of
the problem in the minds of the members of the class
and prevent any subsequent misunderstanding of
them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, what do you
estimate the mission of our battalion to be?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “We are an element of the force
sent out to cover the concentration of the Blue forces
and prevent the enemy from interfering with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We have not yet gained contact
with the enemy. Why do we halt at this time?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “There may be one or more
reasons for it. In the first place, we are a detachment
of a larger force (our regiment), and it is probable
that before we started out, instructions were
given our battalion commander to halt in this locality,
so as to be on the general line of all the covering
troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is correct. Our battalion
must conform to the general plan of the operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before going further let us consider the process
by which our battalion commander arrived at his
decision to halt and make the disposition indicated
in his order. He has sized up the situation with respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>to his mission, the enemy, our own troops; considered
the plans of action open to him and the enemy;
and the terrain. Based on all of this he decides
to halt for the night with the advance guard as
the outpost and the other companies bivouacking as
indicated in the order. Now, let us see how well this
order conforms to the form laid down in Field Service
Regulations. Captain Hall, what are the elements
of an order as applied to the halt of a command
on the march?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “The first part contains information
of the enemy and our own troops. The next is the
plan of the commander in general terms. In this
case it is merely to halt for the night, with the added
sentence to the effect that march conditions cease.
Next comes the tactical dispositions in which each
element of the command is given orders as to just
what it is to do. The last section of this paragraph
tells what action is to be taken in case the enemy
should make an attack. Then comes the disposition
of the trains or administrative arrangements, and
finally the location of the battalion C. P. is indicated
by telling where messages are to be sent. All of this
is included in the order, and I should say that every
essential point has been covered satisfactorily.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, why is Company
E detailed to furnish the outpost?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “It is the general rule that
troops are detailed on covering duty for a period of
twenty-four hours. Company E has been our advance
guard for today’s march. If the battalion
continues the march again tomorrow morning,
another rifle company will be detailed to form the advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>guard. It will get into advance guard formation
before it reaches Company E’s outpost line, and
when the advance guard support crosses the line of
outpost supports it assumes responsibility for the
protection of the column, the outpost troops are withdrawn
and take their proper place in the column.
Then, too, the advance guard is in the best position
to continue the protection of the battalion. It has
merely to change its formation from an advance
guard to that of an outpost, which involves the least
marching on the part of the troops.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We will now go forward to the
point where the support of the advance guard is
halted on the road. How far would that be, Captain
James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I should say that the support
should be about 500 yards in advance of the main
body of the battalion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The class is now conducted about 500 yards down
the road to the place where the support of the advance
guard is supposed to be halted.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Before proceeding further with
the problem it is necessary for us to decide upon the
formation of the advance guard at this time. Just
what do you think the formation would be, Captain
James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “The support would be right here
in column of squads on the road. It would consist
of the company (less one platoon and two connecting
files). About 400 yards farther down the road would
be the advance party, consisting of one platoon, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>which there would be a point of one squad, about 150
yards farther to the front.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c026'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we can all agree on those
dispositions and proceed to the solution of our problem
based on them. Now, let each member of the
class consider himself to be Captain E, commanding
the advance guard. You have attended the assembly
of officers at the head of the main body and received
the major’s orders. You have now returned to the
company and are ready to go ahead with your part
of the operation, that of posting the outpost. Just
how are you going about the task that has been allotted
to you? Captain Hodges, tell us what you would
do.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would first send a runner to
Lieutenant M, commanding the advance party, telling
him to report to me here. While waiting for
Lieutenant M to come back I would size up the situation
and decide upon my tactical dispositions.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would be your primary dispositions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would have a line of supports
on which I would employ one platoon and one section
and a reserve consisting of the rest of the company.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That would be a reasonable disposition.
How many supports would you have Captain
Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would have three supports—one
on the main road and one at a suitable interval on
each side of the road. There would be a section in
each support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, do you agree
with that disposition?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “No, sir. It seems to me that
two supports would meet the situation better. In
the first place, this main road is the route on which
any considerable force of the enemy must advance
after dark, and I would want to cover it with a relatively
strong force. I would put one support on the
road and have it extend over to the right for a sufficient
distance to cover the front and the immediate
right flank. It would extend its front to the left
of the main road. I would have support No. 2 off to
the left to cover that flank.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c026'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>“Support No. 1 would consist of one platoon and
No. 2 of one section.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Explain why you extend the front
of your support No. 1 to the left of the road?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “So that the boundary line between
supports will not fall on the road. One man
must be made responsible for the covering of this
main road, and if I make it the boundary line between
supports, even if I include it in the front of
one of them, it will be more or less neglected. But
if I extend the front of support No. 1 beyond the road
to the left, I am reasonably sure that it will be taken
care of properly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is the point I wanted to bring
out. I hope that all the members of the class see it.
We have now to decide upon the troops to be designated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>for each of the supports. What would be
your decision as to that, Lieutenant Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would have the first platoon,
which now forms the advance party, form support
No. 1 which will be posted on this main and
cover the front from that —— (indicating right
boundary of front) to that —— (indicating left
boundary of front). The first section of the second
platoon would form support No. 2. It would be
posted at —— and cover the front from —— to
——.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a reasonable disposition.
Where would you have your reserve?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would have it posted at
——.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “There is one point on which we
have not yet touched. That is the matter of the
covering of the posting of the outguards. What
would you do about that, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would let each support cover
the posting of its own outguards. I believe they can
do it better and more efficiently than any detachment
that may be made from the rest of the company for
the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us now assume that Lieutenant
M has arrived and you are all ready to issue your
orders. Just how would you go about it, Lieutenant
Williams?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would assemble the officers,
platoon sergeants and section leaders in front
of the company. I would give the command: 1. Company,
2. ATTENTION, and follow with AT EASE.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>I would then say: ‘Let me have your attention.’ I
would issue my orders as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Small detachments of the enemy have been reported
at (<i>h</i>) and (<i>i</i>) (indicating where the places are). Our
3rd Battalion is halted for the night at (<i>k</i>). Our regiment
(less 2nd and 3rd Battalions) is halted for the night at
(<i>l</i>). Our battalion halts for the night at (<i>m</i>) (point out
location). March conditions have ceased.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c026'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“‘This company furnishes the outpost along the (<i>n</i>)

<p class='c017'>“‘Lieutenant M, with the first platoon, will form support

the front from —— (inclusive) to —— (inclusive).</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Lieutenant N, with the second platoon (less one section),

<p class='c017'>“‘The rolling kitchen will be with the reserve. Meals
will be cooked and distributed to the supports.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to the reserve.’”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You will note that the order given
by Lieutenant Williams follows the form of the five paragraph
order and covers all essentials. Are there
any questions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “It seems to me that we are imposing
on the first platoon. They have been on advance
party duty all day, and now we propose to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>keep them on front-line observation duty all night.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “If the platoon had had any serious
contact with the enemy during the day, it would have
been proper to bring it back to the reserve, but they
have just been marching along on the road. They
have had practically no flank patroling to do and are
in just as good shape as the rest of the company. I
can see no reason for not detailing them for support
duty tonight. The platoon is out in front, near the
place where it is to be posted.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the point on the road
where the advance party is supposed to be halted.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We are now at the point where the
first platoon, which is the advance party of the advance
guard, is halted. Lieutenant M has joined his
platoon and is ready to proceed with the execution of
the task allotted to him.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 2</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant M, have joined your platoon here.
The platoon has been designated to form support No.
1. The Captain’s order was as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lieutenant M, with the first platoon will form support
No. 1, which, posted on the road at ——, will cover the
front from —— (inclusive) to —— (inclusive).”</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Carry out your mission.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads Situation No. 2 aloud and explains
that each member of the class should now consider
himself to be Lieutenant M, commanding the
first platoon, designated to form support No. 1.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, how would you
go about carrying out your mission?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would first size up the situation
and arrive at a decision as to what I am going to
do and how I am going to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How is security provided for during
the time that the outpost is being posted?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “By sending out some troops to
cover the posting of the outguards. This is sometimes
provided for by the outpost commander detailing
a unit for the purpose of covering all the outguards
and then withdrawing to the reserve. The
alternative is to have each support cover the posting
of its own outguards. The latter system has been
adopted in this problem, and we will have to provide
our own covering troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span><i>The Director</i>: “What troops would you detail for
this duty?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would send out the first section
(less the squad on duty as point) under the section
commander. I would have the point withdraw
to the support as soon as the covering troops have
taken over the duty of security.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a reasonable solution.
Into what parts is an outpost support divided,
Lieutenant Barry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “Into the support proper and
the outguards. From the outguards sentinels are
posted.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What are the duties assigned to
each of the component parts of the support?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “The support proper is the
fighting element of the outpost. It is posted on the
line where the outpost will make its stand. The outguards
with their sentinels from the observation element.
They are posted on the line of observation.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “That may be the usual line up for
the support. But is it not a fact that sometimes the
outguards are posted on the fighting line?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes. It may be that the line of
observation is also the best fighting line for the supports.
In that case we say ‘the line of observation
and the line of resistance coincide’—that is, they are
the same. When we issue the order for the support
we make provision for that by stating: ‘In case of
attack the outguards will be supported.’ This means
that the outguards will hold their positions and the
supports will come up to them in case the enemy attacks.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span><i>Captain Hall</i>: “In that case, why not place the support
right up on the line of resistance in the first
place?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, can you answer
Captain Hall’s question?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I believe I can give a reason
for it. If we should place the support right up on the
line of outguards we would commit it to one position,
and in case of attack it would be difficult to move it
to meet the enemy’s main effort. If we keep it at a
central point to the rear of the line, we can readily
move it to any point where it may be most needed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. We do not want
to commit our support to action until we find out the
direction of the enemy’s attack. The shifting of
troops along a front line is a most difficult and hazardous
operation. I hope you see the point, Captain
Hall.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “Yes, sir. I do.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c026'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How many outguards do you think
are required on the front assigned to the support,
Captain Jones?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “I should have one on the main
road leading toward the enemy; another on the right
of the road in the vicinity of —— (indicating); and
another to the left of the road in the vicinity of ——
(indicating). I think this would be sufficient for observation
purposes.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span><i>The Director</i>: “Upon what main elements do you
base the strength of these outguards?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Jones</i>: “On the number of sentinel posts
they must maintain. If a double sentinel post is required,
a sentry squad should be allotted to the outguard.
If only a single sentinel is required, the outguard
should be a cossack post.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is exactly the point I wanted
to bring out. We will take it up in detail later on
in the problem. Let us assume that three outguards
will be required to cover the front. No. 1, on the
right of the road, is to be a sentry squad; No. 2,
posted on the road, is also to be a sentry squad; and
No. 3, posted on the left of the road, is to be a cossack
post. How many men in a cossack post, Captain
Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “A non-commissioned officer and
three men. This number furnishes a commander for
the post and three reliefs for a single sentinel post.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is correct. Are there any
questions on the points that we have been discussing?”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c026'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We are now ready to issue Lieutenant
M’s order for the establishment of support No.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>1. Captain Hodges, please tell us the first and second
paragraphs of the order.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would tell the men about
where the enemy is and all I know about our own
troops and then tell them what we are going to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Now, assume that you
are Lieutenant M, and the rest of us here are the
members of your platoon. Put all you have said in
the form of an order to us.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “You want me to do everything
I would do if I were Lieutenant M?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would give the command: 1.
Platoon, 2. ATTENTION, and order CLOSE UP. I
assume that the men are in columns of files, one on
each side of the road. I then give the command AT
EASE, and caution the men, ‘Let me have your attention.’
I direct, ‘Noncommissioned officers assemble
here.’ I then give the order for the establishment
of the support as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Small detachments of the enemy have been reported
at (<i>h</i>) and (<i>i</i>). Our 3rd Battalion is halted for the night
at (<i>k</i>). Our regiment (less the 2nd and 3rd Battalions) is

night at (<i>m</i>). Our company furnishes the outpost with
the second platoon (less one section) as support No. 2 at
—— and the remainder of the company as reserve at ——
March conditions have ceased.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘This platoon forms support No. 1.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what does the
third paragraph of the order deal with?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “With the disposition of troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span><i>The Director</i>: “Will you state what you think
should go into it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Yes, sir. I think it should be
as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Sergeant X, with the first section (less one squad),
will cover the posting of the outguards, and on completion
of that duty withdraw to the support.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal W, with the fourth squad, will form outguard
No. 1, which, posted in the vicinity of ——, will
cover the front from —— (inclusive) to —— (inclusive).</p>

will be maintained.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The remainder of the platoon will be posted at ——

<p class='c017'>“‘In case of attack the outguards will be supported.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, what elements
does the rest of the order contain?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “The next paragraph contains
the administrative arrangements. In the platoon
the main thing is the messing of the men. They will
all want to know about the arrangements for meals.

<p class='c017'>“‘Meals will be distributed to the outguards by details
from the support.’</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The next phase of our problem
deals with the matter of covering the posting of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>outguards. In the posting of the outguards there will
unavoidably be more or less moving around and exposure
to view of the enemy’s patrols, should any be
lurking in the vicinity. The non-commissioned officers
will be seeking out the best positions for their
outguards, selecting observation posts for their sentinels
and making arrangements for defense. The
officers will be moving from point to point along the
line making inspections, pointing out errors, rectifying
the position of the various elements and making
a sketch of the sector covered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In order that all of this may be accomplished in
security, it is necessary to have covering detachments
well out to the front to prevent small parties of the
enemy interfering with the work in hand or making
observations that would enable them to form an estimate
of the position occupied by the outposts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are two methods by which the covering
force may accomplish its mission:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. It may deploy as a line of skirmishers at
greatly extended intervals.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. It may cover the front with a number of small
patrols.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No hard and fast rule can be laid down that will
provide for all contingencies. The first method has
the disadvantage of being most difficult for the non-commissioned
officers to control the action of the men.
The second method possesses the great advantage of
having each group directly under the control of a
leader, so that in case the enemy’s patrols are encountered
and it is necessary to drive them back,
there can be concert of action instead of dependence
on the decisions of individual men as to what is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>done in the emergency. The method to be employed
will depend upon circumstances, the nature of the
country, the number of men available for the duty
and the proximity of the enemy. It may be advisable
to use a combination of the two systems.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 3</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant X, have been detailed to cover the
posting of the outguards. Lieutenant M’s order to
you is as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Sergeant X, with the first section (less one squad),
will cover the posting of the outguards and on completion
of that duty withdraw to the support.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The troops have been turned over to you and you
have been directed to move out.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>Carry out your mission.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the situation aloud and calls
upon one or more members of the class to state his
understanding of it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to consider himself as being Sergeant X. You
have your troops right here on the road and everything
is ready to proceed with the work in hand. Just
how do you go about carrying out your mission?
Lieutenant Wallace, what is the first move you would
make?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would want to get my men
away from the rest of the platoon so I can give them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>their instructions without having their attention
diverted by other things.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Let us assume that you
have done so and you have them right here. We are
now ready to proceed. Go ahead with your solution.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “In the first place, I would
not want the men to be burdened with their packs, so
I would have them taken off and piled here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Would you have them take off the
entire pack? Tell us just what equipment they
would carry.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Only the rifle and belt.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, do you agree
with that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “No, sir. I would have the
men take off only the rolls. I would have them carry
the haversack with them. The Infantry pack is designed
for this very purpose. We can relieve the
men of the burdensome part of the pack and still retain
the essentials. I do not believe a man should
ever be without his haversack in the field.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are correct. Let us assume
that we have taken the rolls off and piled them here.
Now, Lieutenant Wallace, what are you going to
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I am going to give my orders.
All the men of the section have heard the platoon
commander’s orders about the enemy and our
own troops, so there is no necessity for repeating
them. The next thing is to tell the men what our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>mission is to be. I would cover this by the simple
statement:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘This section (less the first squad) will cover the
posting of the outguards.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will now have to decide upon the formation that
I am going to take up. The front to be covered is too
extensive to be covered by a line of skirmishers, and
besides I do not approve of such a formation. It is
too difficult to control the operations. I would use
the patrol method. Divide the section up into small
patrols and keep a small support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, do you agree
with such dispositions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Yes, sir. I think the patrol
formation is best. It has many advantages over the
line of skirmishers.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How many patrols would you
have?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I should have three patrols
of a leader and three men each. This would account
for the second squad and the front rank of the third
squad. I would keep the rear rank of the third
squad under my own control as a support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Based on that disposition, what
orders would you give?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal D, take the front rank of your squad and
move out to the right oblique in the direction of that ——.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Private E, you are detailed as acting corporal. Take
the rear rank of the second squad and move to the front
along this road.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal F, take the front rank of your squad and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>move out to the left oblique in the direction of that ——.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The rear rank of the third squad will accompany
me. I will march 200 yards in rear of Private E’s patrol.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Patrols will advance about 1,200 yards to the front.
Keep in communication with me. Remain out until you
receive orders to withdraw.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Take charge of your patrols and move out.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe these orders would set the covering
troops in motion.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I agree with you. Are there any
questions? I assume that when no questions are
asked every member of the class not only understands
what is being done, but also the reasons for
doing it that particular way. If there is ever any
doubt in your mind about any part of the problem
or the solution, you should ask questions and demand
explanations until the matter is entirely cleared up.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to write out Sergeant X’s orders on his pad.
The information about the enemy and our own troops
that has already been given to the men by the platoon
commander need not be repeated. The first paragraph
might be.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You have heard what the platoon commander said
about the enemy and our own troops. There is no further
information.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all the members of the class have completed
writing the order the papers are collected and redistributed.
One or more members may be called upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>to read the order in their possession and comment
upon it. The whole idea is to impress the solution
of each phase of the problem so firmly in the minds
of the members of the class that, in case they should
ever be called upon in active service to meet a similar
situation, they would know exactly how to go about it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted down the road to the
point where outguard No. 2 is to be posted.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The order of the platoon commander
requires Corporal V, with the fifth squad, to
post outguard No. 2 on the main road in this vicinity
and covering the front from —— (exclusive) to
—— (exclusive).</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director points out the limits of the front to
be covered by the outguards.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“There are some definite rules that may be laid
down governing the location of an outguard. In the
first place, the location within reasonable limits has
been designated by the support commander in his
order. We are to cover the main road leading from
the direction in which the enemy is reported to be.
The outguard should occupy a good defensive position—that
is, it should have a good field of fire to the
front and in oblique directions toward both flanks.
It should be so far concealed that the enemy could
not discover it without attacking.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>Situation No. 4 is now handed out to the members
of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Corporal V, have been given the fifth squad,
and ordered to establish outguard No. 2 in this vicinity.
You have arrived at this point with your squad.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>How will you carry out your mission?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the problem aloud and calls
upon one or more members of the class to explain
their understanding of it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to visualize this situation—to consider himself
as being Corporal V. You have arrived here with
your squad to establish outguard No. 2. Just how do
you propose to go about it? Captain Hastings, what
would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Well, sir, I would first decide
where I am going to post the outguard and then decide
upon the number of sentinels I am to post and
where I am to post them. I have the limits of the
front assigned to me definitely pointed out. I must
first find a location for the outguard that will cover
this front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Have you decided upon such a location?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Yes, sir. My outguard posted
at —— would accomplish the desired results. In
the first place, any considerable body of the enemy
must travel at night on a well defined road or trail.
He cannot strike off across country unless elaborate
preparations are made for guiding his columns. We
would know about any such preparations and could
counter them. If I cover this main road and the
country adjacent to it, I will be able to accomplish
my mission.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director should bring out all the elements connected
with the selection of the position of the ground in question.
There will be many small points that may be brought
up for consideration such as: Is the position selected a good
one for defense? Is there a good field of fire? Is there cover
for the enemy to conceal a formation for attack? Is the position
naturally strong; if not, can it be made so? Can obstacles
be so placed as to hold the enemy under effective fire of the
outguard? Is there ground to the front or flanks within rifle
or machine gun range that commands the position? Are there
good approaches to the sentinel posts from the outguard? Is
it possible to provide for mutual supporting fire with the other
outguards? Are there good communications with the adjoining
outguards and with the support? While it is not contemplated
that an outguard position will fulfill all of these conditions,
it should be selected so as to fulfill as many of them as possible.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “In your discussion a minute ago
you stated that you would determine the number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>sentinels to be posted. Just what do you mean by
that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I will want to post a sufficient
number of sentinels to keep the sector of the front
allotted to me under observation at all times. I have
not yet decided how many will be required.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is just the point I wanted to
bring out. The number of sentinels that you can post
is determined by the strength of your outguard. You
can post only one double sentinel post from a squad.
If more than one is required your outguard must
be allotted additional men for the purpose. Now, let
us see how this proposition works out in practice.
You have seven men besides yourself. This will provide
three reliefs for one double sentinel post and
give you one spare man. The outguard is to be on
duty until the march is resumed tomorrow morning.
You cannot expect to keep all the men on post all
the time. They must have their rest if they are expected
to march tomorrow. Sentinels are ordinarily
on post for two hours, after which they are given a
four-hour period of rest before going on post again.
To do otherwise is to wear your men out and render
them unfit for further service. Let us all get this
system firmly fixed in our minds. A squad furnishes
three reliefs for a double sentinel post. If only a
single sentinel is required, a cossack post will furnish
three reliefs for it. I hope you will all see the
point.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I understand the system now.
But, suppose I should determine that at least two
double sentinel posts are necessary, what should I
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, can you
answer the captain’s question?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would send a report to
the platoon commander setting forth my views of the
situation and request that another squad be sent to
the outguard.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That would be a proper procedure.
The initial disposition of the outguard is only tentative.
Soon after the outguards are posted the support
commander will be out to make his inspection
of them. At that time the situation may be represented
to him, and he can make his decision as to
whether or not he deems it necessary to supply the
additional men.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The exact location of the outguard should be decided
upon at this time, and the tentative position of the sentinels
should be determined.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We have decided upon the location
of the outguard, and the dispositions to be made. It
is now necessary to embody these in the form of
orders to the members of the squad. Lieutenant
Hunt, what should this order contain?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “Do you want me to give the
entire order for the posting of the outguard?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes. If any point comes up that
is not fully understood by a member of the class, he
should feel free to interrupt with a question.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “The men have all the information
about the enemy and our own troops. It is not
necessary to repeat that. I would cover this by
saying:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“‘You have heard the information about the enemy
and our own troops. The first section is out in front
covering the posting of the outguards.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would then state the mission of the squad.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘This squad forms outguard No. 2 of support No. 1.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tactical dispositions are next in order. The
reliefs have to be told off and other arrangements
made.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Hanna and Crow (riflemen), first relief; Smith and
Carney (riflemen), second relief; Harris and Welch
(riflemen), third relief; Rainer (automatic rifleman),
spare man.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Rainer, you select the tentative positions for your
automatic rifle and get ready to prepare them for occupation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The members of the second and third reliefs will
prepare the bivouac for the outguard and the firing positions
which I will designate later.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘In case of attack we will be supported.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The administrative arrangements are simple.
They will relate to the messing of the men.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Meals will be sent up from the support.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then the location of the outguard commander
will be stated:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to me, here.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will then direct the men to remove their packs
and order:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘First relief, FOLLOW ME.’”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You seem to have covered the essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>points of the order of an outguard commander.
Now, in order to impress it on your minds,
I want each member of the class to write out the
order on his pad. Follow the form of the five paragraph
order and try to get the wording just as was
given by Lieutenant Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all have finished writing the order the
papers are collected and distributed again. Members
of the class are called upon to read and comment
on the order they have in their possession.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The Director should insist that members of the class
prepare these orders with great care and attention to detail.
It will be found that there is a tendency to slight them and take
a lot for granted.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We are now ready to proceed with
the next step of the problem, the posting of the first
relief. Before we go into that I want to make a few
remarks about the location of sentinel posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By day the sentinel must be able to see the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>of the ground allotted to him for observation. He
should be provided with sufficient cover so that the
enemy’s patrols will not be able to locate him. He
should have good communication with the outguard
and the adjoining sentinels. Excellent observation
posts may sometimes be found in large trees, one of
the sentinels of the double post being located in a
tree and the other on the ground near the foot of the
tree. It may be that the best location for observation
is also the best for resistance, in which case the sentinels
may be posted on or very near the actual locality
to be defended by the outguard. There is no
objection to this, provided the members of the outguard,
as well as the sentinel, are well concealed from
the view of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The location of the sentinel post at night requires
the most careful consideration. It depends
considerably upon the degree of darkness, and consequently
the value of eyesight as compared with hearing.
On a very dark night, when the sentinel can see
only a few yards in front of him, it is evident that his
ears will be more useful than his eyes. Furthermore,
the difficulties of the enemy will be increased by the
darkness, and he is likely to make more noise by
stumbling over unseen obstructions. On a still night
a sentinel posted on high ground can hear better than
when on low ground, because there is likely to be less
obstruction in the way of trees and other objects to
interfere with the sound waves passing through the
atmosphere. It therefore appears that on a very
dark night, when the ears are more efficient than the
eyes, the sentinel should be posted on high ground,
with low ground to his front.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“When the darkness is not so great and the powers
of sight more nearly approach in value the powers
of hearing, it is better to place the sentinel on low
ground, with the sky line to his front. This is because
approaching persons will be silhouetted on the
sky line and that it is difficult to see when looking
down from a height into a dark valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The night post should always be provided with
an obstacle placed from 10 to 30 yards to the front of
the sentinel. It must be low, so that it will not be
seen by an approaching enemy. Its value is increased
if a wire or rope is attached to some object
that will fall down with a loud noise when anyone
trips over the obstacle.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to the place where the
sentinel post is to be established.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Barry, where would
you locate your sentinel post?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would locate it at ——”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The location of the sentinel post should be determined
upon after careful consideration of all the factors that enter
into the problem.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director now distributes the sheets containing
Situation No. 5.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 5</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been decided to locate double sentinel post
No. 1 of outguard No. 2 at this point. You, Corporal
V, have arrived here with the members of the
first relief.</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The orders and instructions you give your
sentinels.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The sentinels must have imparted
to them all information of the enemy and our own
troops. With respect to the latter, they must be fully
informed of the covering patrols that have been sent
out and the location of the adjoining sentinel posts.
The location of the main body of the outguard should
be pointed out, and, if practicable, the position of adjoining
outguards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They will be given the number of their own post
and the number of the outguard from which they
are posted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They will be informed as to the points to which
the roads and trails lead, and, if practicable, the
names of important topographical points in sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They will be given the countersign, if one is used.
The method of challenge and identification of persons
approaching the outpost sentinels at night
should be changed from time to time so that there
will be less chance for the enemy to know just what
system is being used on a particular night. On one
occasion a countersign using the name of a battle or
general may be used; on another night the system of
tapping the knuckles on the rifle stock may be employed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The mistake of giving sentinels too many orders
and instructions should be carefully avoided. If
their minds are burdened with too many details, they
are likely to become hesitating, timid and confused.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The controlling idea is that they should know where
to look for the enemy and what to do if they see
him.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, having in mind what
I have just said, what orders would you give your
sentinels?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would give them the following
orders:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You have all the information of the enemy and our
own troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You are double sentinel post No. 1 of outguard No.
2 of support No. 1. Outguard No. 1 is —— (point out
location). Outguard No. 3 is —— (point out location).
Information of the exact location of the sentinel posts
will be given to you later.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘This road leads to ——. That trail leads in the
direction of ——.   That —— is known as the ——.</p>

<p class='c029'>(Note—Locate and name other important topographical features
in view.)</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘If you see the enemy, signal to me at the outguard.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘The countersign will be given to you later.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think that covers the orders for
your sentinel very well. The big idea is that we
should not burden them with too many things to
think about. We will omit the written solution of
this part of the problem.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “There are certain rules for the
guidance of a sentinel on post with which all officers
and soldiers should be familiar. They must be scrupulously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>observed under all circumstances. They
are:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. He must watch and listen without betraying
his presence. Observation is the first consideration
and concealment of secondary importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. He must not smoke, and matches must not be
lighted at night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. Such conversation as is absolutely necessary
must be conducted in subdued tones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. He must not have any arms or accoutrements
that will glitter in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“5. Except at night and in foggy weather, the bayonet
must be kept in the scabbard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“6. Persons arrested are ordinarily held at the
post until a patrol comes out to take charge of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“7. He will not allow his vigilance to be disturbed
by the requirements of military etiquette. He pays
no compliments and does not salute officers unless
addressed by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“8. Everything that he observes with respect to
the enemy must be communicated to the outguard
commander, especial care being taken to report
promptly all indication of the enemy’s approach. If
he is satisfied that the enemy is advancing to attack,
the alarm may be given by firing. When immediate
alarm is not necessary, firing should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is nothing that so irritates troops as needless
outpost firing at night, when they need rest.
Needless firing, besides alarming the outpost troops,
and possibly those of the main body, gives information
to the enemy of the location of the line of observation,
from which he is able to deduce the position
of the outguards. It should be an invariable rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>that sentinels do not fire except as a last resort.
There is never any necessity for it except when the
covering patrols are being driven in and are being
hard pressed, in which case the sentinel may fire to
assist in covering the withdrawal, if such action is
absolutely necessary. Night firing is of little value
in any event. It is only effective for very short distances,
and should be discouraged by every possible
means.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “After sufficient time has elapsed

their duties? Do they know what to do if they should
see the enemy?</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. Have provisions been made for rapid communication

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Terrain Exercise No. 8.</i><br /> A Visiting Patrol</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>Special Situation</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>A blue force operating in hostile country halts at
(<i>a</i>) and establishes an outpost along the line (<i>b</i>).
Support No. 2 is located at (<i>c</i>) with outguard No. 1
at (<i>d</i>); outguard No. 2 at (<i>e</i>) and outguard No. 3
at (<i>f</i>).</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Lieutenant A are in command of Support
No. 2, consisting of your platoon and located at this
point. The first section furnishes the outguards and
the platoon (less 1st Section) the main body of the
support. You have made the inspection of your line
of observation and sent your report to the company
commander.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What arrangements do you make for visiting patrols?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation of Letter Symbols</h4>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>) The location of the bivouac of the main body
of the Blue force. This should be located at a central
point with reference to the outpost line.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) Designate the general line of the Blue outpost.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) The location of Support No. 2. It should be
located at a central point with reference to the line
of outguards.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>(<i>d</i>)-(<i>e</i>)-(<i>f</i>) The location of the three outguards
posted from Support No. 2.</p>

<p class='c010'>In fitting this exercise to the ground the location
of the outguards should be selected first. Care
should be taken to so locate them that the ground is
suitable for illustrating the tactical features that are
to be brought out and discussed in the Terrain Exercise.
The location of Support No. 2 should then be
selected and finally that of the Blue main body. If
you have had a previous Terrain Exercise covering
the subject of outposts it may be convenient and advantageous
to base this Terrain Exercise on the same
situation and covering the same ground.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is conducted to (<i>c</i>), the location of Support
No. 2.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the sheets containing the
Special Situation and Situation No. 1, reads them
aloud to the class and makes such explanation as may
be necessary. One or more members of the class may
be called upon to state his understanding of the
situation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “It is fully realized that no member
of this class will ever be called upon to conduct the
operations of a visiting patrol. You will, however,
have to order your non-commissioned officers to do so
and you must have a knowledge of how it should be
gone about and whether the duty is being properly
performed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The military text-books usually tell you that a
visiting patrol consists of a non-commissioned officer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and two or three men that make the rounds
along the outpost line of observation at night. That
is about all. It is assumed that the subject is so
simple that you just naturally know it and there is
nothing further to be explained. Such is not the case
and before we have completed this exercise we will
demonstrate it to you. Another good test of the
proposition is this: Take your non-commissioned officers
out on a Terrain Exercise and give them the
situations that we will have today. See how many
of them get away with it. I am sure you will be surprised
at the results, especially with the men who
have had no previous preparation for the exercise.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what is a
visiting patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “It is a patrol consisting of
a non-commissioned officer and two or three men. It
is sent out from the support at intervals during the
night to keep up communication between the elements
of the outpost.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, tell us just how
the visiting patrol makes its rounds.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Let us say that the patrol is
to start out from our support No. 2, which is located
at this point. The patrol will go out to the right and
touch upon the left outguard of Support No. 1; then
pass along our own line of observation to the right
outguard of Support No. 3 and then come back
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes, that is the general procedure.
The details of how the patrol is to do all of this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>what we are interested in and that is what will be
brought out in this Terrain Exercise. Lieutenant
Wallace, what do you understand to be the specific
duties of a visiting patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Included in the duties of
visiting patrols may be enumerated:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. They bring back information of incidents that
may occur along the line of observation and form a
medium of exchange of information between the various
elements of the outpost.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. In a measure, they prevent the unobserved approach
of the enemy between sentinel posts. When
the enemy is very active there is constant patrolling
between the observation posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. They drive off small patrols.</p>

<p class='c010'>“4. They take charge of detained persons and conduct
them back to the support.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. Now, Lieutenant
Ralston, suppose you were Lieutenant A, commanding
Support No. 2. What instructions would
you give regarding your visiting patrols?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “The visiting patrol is a night
institution. There is little necessity for its employment
in the day time, but I would not wait until dark
to give my instructions regarding it. I would give
orders:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘There is no further information of the enemy and
our own troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The second section will furnish the visiting patrols
for tonight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal Black, with the 4th Squad, will conduct
the visiting patrols at 8 and 10 o’clock p. m.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“‘Corporal Canes, with the 5th Squad, will conduct
the visiting patrols at 12 midnight and 2 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal Dorr with the 6th Squad, will conduct the
visiting patrols at 4 and 6 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Patrol leaders will go over the route of their patrols
before dark.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages to support, here.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you have covered the necessary
points.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are there any questions by any member of the
class? If so, now is the time to clear them up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Corporal Canes, have been designated to conduct

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes the sheets bearing Situation
No. 2 to the members of the class, reads it
aloud and makes such explanations as may be necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now I want each member of the
class to consider himself as being Corporal Canes.
Put yourself in his place and consider what you
would do under the orders you have received from
the support commander. We are going to work
these situations out in detail to show you how it
ought to be done. Then when you are a support commander
and give an order for your visiting patrols,
you will know just how each Corporal should go
about his job.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what would you
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would get the men of my
squad together and while they are assembling I
would size up the situation and determine just what
orders I am going to give. When the men are together
I would give them their orders:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley, Harrison and Kline will be the first visiting
patrol.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Oliver, Hasker and Payne will be the second visiting

<p class='c017'>“‘We go out at 12 and 2 o’clock tonight. Be ready

<p class='c017'>“‘I am going over the route of the patrol before dark.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Dismissed.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“I do not think of anything else to say at this
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, have you any
criticism to make of Captain Harvey’s order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Yes, sir. In the first place, he
has left out several things that ought to be told to the
men. He has not provided any instructions for one
man of the squad. He has not made it clear just
which patrol each man belongs to. He has not told
the men what equipment they are to carry with
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “To what do you attribute these
omissions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “Well, sir, I could not say. The
thing that appeals to me is that if I were one of the
men I would want to know about them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think, if you will all reflect, that
the underlying trouble with Captain Harvey’s order
is that he has not followed our five paragraph order.
Had he done so, I am sure he would not have omitted
these essentials. Now I am going to have Captain
Harvey give the order again and follow the five paragraph
order system and see how he comes out. Your
first paragraph would be ‘Information of the enemy
and our supporting troops.’ All right, Captain
Harvey, what would your first paragraph contain?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Well, sir, the men know everything
that I do regarding the enemy and our own
troops. They all heard the Lieutenants order when
he established the support. So I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘There is no further information of the enemy or our
supporting troops.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span><i>The Director</i>: “You have stated it exactly in your
last sentence. Now for your plan.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “My plan would be to have the
squad furnish two of the visiting patrols—I see what
you mean.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Our squad will furnish two visiting patrols tonight.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now comes the disposition of
troops and orders for each element.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would divide up the squad as
I did in my previous order and provide for that
extra man that Captain Hodges spoke of. He is my
Automatic Rifleman. I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley, Harrison and Kline will be visiting patrol
No. 1. It will go out at 12 o’clock midnight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Oliver, Hasker and Payne will be visiting patrol
No. 2. It will go out at 2 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Bailey (automatic rifleman) will be supernumerary.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The next is your administrative
arrangements, paragraph 4 of an order. What
would you include in that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “The equipment to be carried.
I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Rifle and belts of ammunition only will be carried.
The bayonet will be fixed. The scabbard and canteen will
be left here.’</p>

<p class='c018'>I would not want the men to carry anything that is
not absolutely essential.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. The members of
the visiting patrol travel light. They do not want to
be hampered with equipment that is not necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Above all, they do not want anything with them that
will rattle and make a noise. They leave the bayonet
scabbard at the post of the support because if they
wear it on the belt it will be dangling between the
men’s legs and interfere with their freedom of movement.
They will probably not need any water on
this short march so I see no objection to leaving the
canteen behind, although, on the other hand, I can
see no objection to carrying it. That is a mere
matter of opinion. The bayonets are fixed so as to
have them ready for hand to hand night fighting in
case it is required. A great deal of the night work
will be done with the bayonet. Rifle fire is effective
only for short distances due to inability to see the
target for any distance. Now, Captain Harvey, how
do you conclude your order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “In the usual manner by telling
the men where messages are to be brought, I would
say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Messages will be brought back to the support, here.’”</p>

<p class='c018'>That concludes the order. I see my error and will
profit by it in the future.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “There is one point in the order
that I did not understand. Captain Harvey detailed
his automatic rifleman as ‘supernumerary.’ Just
what does he mean by that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “He means that he is an extra man
not specifically detailed with either patrol. But, if
for any reason, one of the other men is unable to go
on the patrol when the time comes the supernumerary
will take his place. Do you see the point now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span><i>Captain James</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I hope you all now realize how far
astray you can go in issuing tactical orders if you
fail to follow the five paragraph system. On the
other hand, I hope you have observed how simple it
is to include all of the essential elements in an order
if you do follow the system. You here see the system
applied to the most insignificant element in the
domain of tactics, the visiting patrol. You see how
nicely it fits. If you were issuing an order for a division
of 20,000 men you would see how well it works
there. I hope you will all stick to this plan of issuing
orders. You positively cannot go far wrong if
you will. If there are no further questions we will
proceed.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Corporal Canes will now dismiss
the squad and the men will go about getting ready
for their night work. Corporal Canes will go over
the route that he is to conduct the patrol tonight. He
will proceed to the right parallel to and in rear of the
line of outguards to the left outguard of Support
No. 1; thence along our own line of observation to
Outguard No. 1 of Support No. 3; and then back to
the support. He will note the route carefully and
mark it if necessary. He will especially note the approaches
to the outguard posts and arrange for recognition
signals with the outguard commanders.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us assume that it is now 11.50
p. m. The obscurity is such that a man may see another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>at a distance of about 12 yards. Corporal
Canes has been awakened by the support sentinel.
He is up and getting ready to start with his patrol.
Captain James, you are now Corporal Canes. What
would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would wake Manley, Harrison
and Kline and say to them:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘It is time to make our 12 o’clock patrol. Get up.
You have about 5 minutes to get ready.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“At 11:55 I would have the patrol fall in for inspection.
I would inspect the men to see if they had
the proper equipment and make sure that each man
is fully awake. I would then give the command:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘With ball cartridges. 2. LOAD.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am now ready to start.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. It is now 12 o’clock.
Give the orders for the start.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley, you will lead; I will follow at a distance of
8 yards; Harrison, you follow me at 10 yards; Kline you
follow Harrison at 12 yards. Move out.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that order would get the patrol under
way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, have you any
criticism of the formation proposed by Captain
James?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “Yes, sir. It seems to me that
here is one instance where the patrol commander
should actually lead the patrol himself. He knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the route that is to be taken and no other member of
the patrol knows it. He is the man that knows the
recognition signals with the outguard commanders.
I think there is every reason why he should physically
lead the patrol.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think so, too, and feel that Captain
James will when he considers the situation. Now
then, this new disposition will change the orders
somewhat. Lieutenant Baker how would you state
the orders now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I will lead. Manley, you follow me at a distance of
about 8 yards. Harrison, follow Manley at a distance of
about 10 yards; Kline will follow Harrison at a distance
of about 10 yards.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Keep the man ahead of you in sight at all times.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley, you will be second in command.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Follow me.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think this order will get our
patrol under way in the proper formation. I hope
you see and understand the necessity for going into
the minute details of these situations. Herein lies
one of the greatest values of the Terrain Exercise.
It not only teaches the student of Minor Tactics the
principles, but affords practice in giving the orders
to meet the various situations and fixes all indelibly
on the mind. When you conduct a Terrain Exercise
yourself you cannot be too particular about going into
the details of every situation.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, let us assume you are

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would go to the sentinel post and
ask the men.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Wait a minute. Let us not go too
fast on this proposition. You have the other men of
your patrol with you. What are you going to do
with them?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “That’s right. I would have to
tell them what to do. I would say to Manley in a low
tone;</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Have the patrol halt and remain in place.’</p>

<p class='c018'>Which means the men would halt where they are and

without first notifying the outguard that you are going
to do so?”</p>

that. I would go to the outguard and tell the outguard
commander that I am going out to see his sentinels

on post are about in the middle of their tour. If
you get the outguard commander out at this time, he
will be up practically all night and will not be fit for
much service tomorrow. I do not think you would
insist on seeing the outguard commander unless he
happened to be awake at this particular time. It
would be sufficient to tell the outguard sentinel what
you are going to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would go to the outguard and
notify the man on duty there that I am going out to
the sentinel.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Don’t go too fast. What I want
to bring out at this time is just how you are going to
approach the post of the outguard. Tell us in detail
how you would do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I will go up to this point. (Captain
Hall advances to the point indicated). I will
call in a low tone of voice ‘Visiting patrol.’ If I get
no response I will advance a little closer and repeat
my recognition signal and would continue until I am
recognized. When the man on duty hears my call he
will probably say to me ‘Give the countersign.’ I
will give the countersign in a low tone of voice. He
will tell me to advance and I will then go to the post
of the outguard.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Those are the details I wanted to
bring out. And that is the value of the Terrain Exercise.
We come out here and learn to do the things
that we must do in actual campaign when we do not
have to pay for the mistakes with our own lives or
the lives of our men. You have to draw upon your
imagination to picture the situation that confronts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>you. You have to use your gray matter to figure out
and decide just what you are going to do. Finally,
you have to draw upon your power of speech to put
your decision into words and express it in a clear and
intelligent manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you get up to the outguard you find that
the outguard commander is asleep. You decide not
to awaken him. You tell the man on duty that you
are going to the sentinel post. Now Lieutenant
Barry I want you to tell us and show us just how you
do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would proceed cautiously in
the direction of the sentinel post. When I figure I
am within hearing distance I will give the recognition
signal. The sentinel will give me the return signal
and I will know everything is all right and be free
to go up to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I do not understand this recognition
signal proposition. Can the director enlighten
us on that?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Yes, we will go into that in a few
minutes. Before doing so I wish to review and consider
in detail this comparatively simple proposition
of approaching a sentinel post at night. You must
remember that the line of observation of an outpost
is a ‘spooky’ place at night and that outpost sentinels
are as easily flushed as a pheasant. Their nerves
are strung to the breaking point. In every shadow
an enemy lurks. They soon learn to take no chances.
It becomes the rule to shoot first and challenge afterwards.
If one makes a practice of running headlong
into sentinel posts on dark nights he may get away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>with it a few times, but you are taking serious
chances and the game will finally get you. Having
these things in mind, let us review the process of approaching
the sentinel post.</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. The patrol leader halts his patrol some little
distance from the post. He gives the orders for the
other members to stand fast until he returns. He
then goes to the outguard and notifies them that he
is going out to the sentinel. There is no necessity
for any other person than the patrol commander going
up to the post. If others go it makes just that
much more confusion and adds that much more
chance for lurking scouts to locate the post and get
information.</p>

<p class='c010'>“2. The patrol leader advances towards the post
and when he is near enough he calls in a low tone,
‘Visiting patrol,’ and continues to call until he is
recognized. We never approach a sentinel post
from the front at night and, if it can be avoided,
never from a flank, always from the rear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. When the sentinel discovers the presence of
the patrol leader he will verify his identity by calling
upon him for the countersign. Corporal Canes gives
the countersign, and the sentinel directs him to advance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This countersign is the recognition signal that
Lieutenant Hunt asked about. It may be given by
word of mouth. It may consist of whistling a few
bars of some familiar service call. It may be made
by tapping with the knuckles on the stock of the rifle.
The number of taps to represent a number, for example:
The countersign or recognition signal is 22-33.
Corporal Canes would approach the sentinel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>post and strike his rifle, tap, tap (pause) tap, tap.
The sentinel will answer in the same manner tap,
tap, tap (pause), tap, tap, tap. He would then know
that he had been recognized as a friend and proceed
to the post. If the sentinel discovered Corporal
Canes first he would keep him under observation and
when he is close enough to hear would challenge him,
tap, tap (pause), tap, tap. Corporal Cane’s answer
would be tap, tap, tap (pause), tap, tap, tap. The
system is interchangeable. The first number may be
said to be the challenge or inquiry signal and the second
number the recognition.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not well, however, to confine ourselves to
any one set of signals or method of identification.
They should be changed frequently, so that the
enemy will never know what system is being used on
any particular night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the countersign is a word it should be
spoken in a very low tone of voice for fear of betraying
it to the enemy’s scouts who may be near by.
History is replete with incidents of disaster to covering
detachments arising from the enemy’s knowledge
of the countersign.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, Lieutenant Hunt, let us assume
that you are at the sentinel post and ready to
make your inspection. Just what would you say to
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “Well, sir, I am free to confess
that I do not know just what I would say, but I would
make a stab at something.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is just the point. Our text-books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>are here deficient again. They assume that
this is so simple that we just naturally know what to
do and what to say. Have you ever seen in any text
book, any where, detailed instructions as to just how
to inspect a sentinel on post. They say: ‘The officer
of the day will inspect.’ I should like for you to be
in a concealed position and hear some ‘Officer of the
day’ make his inspection of a sentinel. Try it sometime
and see the results.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the time that Corporal Canes is with him
the sentinel will not cease his vigilance. The inspection
will be conducted in a low conversational tone.
‘I am Corporal Canes of visiting patrol No. 3 from
Support No. 2.’ ‘What is the number of your post?’
‘What is the number of your outguard?’ ‘Where is
it located?’ ‘Do you know the location of the sentinel
posts to your right and left?’ ‘In what direction
is the enemy?’ ‘Where does that road (trail) lead
to?’ ‘Do you know what that light is (pointing)?’
‘Have you observed any signs of the enemy since you
have been on post?’ ‘What is the countersign (recognition
signal) tonight?’ ‘What would you do if
you saw any signs of the enemy out in front?’ ‘How
would you alarm the outguard?’ ‘I have no information
of the enemy on this immediate front.’ ‘When
I was at outguard No. 3 of Support No. 1 the outguard
commander told me that an enemy scout had
been picked up near the Outguard No. 1 of their support
about an hour ago?’ ‘Notify your outguard
commander when you are relieved that I was here at
—— o’clock.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“These are some of the things that would be included
in the inspection by the patrol commander.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Corporal Canes would now go back to the outguard
and tell the man on duty that he is going on
with the patrol. If, in his inspection of the sentinel
on post, anything happened that the outguard commander
should know about Corporal Canes would
wake him and tell him about it. He will then join
the other members of the patrol and proceed along
the route selected before dark.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—To give the Terrain Exercise added interest it may
be well to send two of the members of the class ahead to represent
sentinel post No. 2 and one to represent the outguard.
They will take post in the normal location of those elements of
the line of observation. Then have four members of the class
represent the visiting patrol. Have the leader conduct them
just as he would under actual service conditions. Make the
approach to outguard No. 2 in the same manner as indicated
herein and carry out all the details of the situation.)</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>On completion of the problem at Outguard No. 2
the class is conducted to a point somewhere between
Outguard No. 2 and Outguard No. 3 where the following
situation is distributed:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The Visiting Patrol has arrived at this point. You,
Corporal Canes, are right here (indicate). You
hear a slight noise in that direction (indicate). In
a moment you see the dim outline of a man. He is
armed with a rifle which he seems to be carrying at
the position of “High Port.” He is stooping forward
and moving very cautiously towards you. Apparently
he has not seen you.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will read the situation aloud and indicate
where Corporal Canes is and where the man
is.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The place selected for this situation should be chosen
with great care. It should preferably be in a woods with some
underbrush and some cleared places. The place where the
patrol is located when the situation is given out should preferably
be at the near edge of one of these clearings.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now I want each member of the
class to visualize the situation as it exists. You are
reminded that it is supposed to be night and you
should base your decisions and actions on that assumption.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what would you
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Am I to understand that the
man approaching is one of our own force or one of
the enemy?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is one of the points of the
problem. You do not know yet whether he is a
friend or enemy. It is dark and impossible to tell.
You merely see the outlines of a man. He is crouching.
Has his rifle at a ‘High Port’ which places it
in readiness for instant action.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would not want to shoot one
of our own men. I guess I would halt and wait and
see what he is going to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The moment you let the man take
the lead you are just one lap behind him in decision
and action. If you do something and take the lead
yourself he will have to make his decisions rapidly
and base his action on what you do. Never lose the
opportunity to put your opponent in that hole. As
far as can be seen, you now have the drop on the man.
Don’t make a blunder and lose the advantage. Of
all tactical offenses, indecision and inaction are the
most to be condemned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Wallace, how do you size up the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “Well, sir, I would hate to
make the mistake of killing one of our own men. But
I consider that no man of this outpost has any business
running around between the lines at this time
of the night unless he is a member of a patrol. If
such is the case the sentinel at No. 2 Outguard would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>have known about that and told me. So, I suppose
if it came to the point of killing him, he would be
paid for. Next, I do not know whether the man is
alone or whether there are others with him. Up to
this time I have only seen one man, and it is not likely
that one man of the enemy would be wandering
around in our lines alone. Considering the possibility
of his being one of our men, I would give him just
one chance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is a very good estimate of the
situation. Now arrive at a decision as to what you
are going to do and tell us about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would halt and crouch
down. The other members of the patrol seeing me
do this would follow my action without any orders.
Without making any noise I would unlock my piece
and aim it at the approaching man. As soon as he
arrived at a point where I could see him sufficiently
in the dark to make sure of hitting him if it were
necessary to fire I would call out in a tone loud
enough for him to hear and understand that I meant
business: ‘Halt! Drop that Rifle! Throw up your
hands!’ If there was the least hesitation on his part
or any move to use his rifle I would fire. In other
words, if he did not drop his rifle instantly and throw
up his hands, I would shoot him. If he obeyed my
orders, I would call to him in a low tone, ‘I have the
drop on you. Do as I say, or I will fire. Walk five
steps towards me and halt.’ I would wait a few seconds
to see if there were any more men behind him
and then call to Manley and Harrison to join me at
the edge of the clearing. While I still covered him and
with my rifle, I would say:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“‘Manley, you go out and search the man. Take any
arms that he may have. Keep out of my way, so I can fire
if necessary. Now get his rifle.’</p>

<p class='c018'>I now have the man a prisoner, and....”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Wait a moment. That is as far as
I want you to go at this time. I think you have
covered the situation very well.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Ralston, it develops that the man is
one of the enemy. You have him a prisoner. What
are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would post Manley and
Harrison to guard against surprise. I would have
Kline join me. Before the prisoner had a chance
to get over his confusion and collect his thoughts I
would try to get some information from him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What questions would you ask
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would ask him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘What outfit do you belong to?</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘What are you doing in our lines?</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Are there any other men of your outfit around here?</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘What is your name and rank?’”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “I hope you have all noted the dispositions
that Lieutenant Ralston made. He posted
two men to guard against surprise, for there may be
more of the enemy in the vicinity. It is fair to assume
that this man is not out alone at this time of the
night. The remaining man of the patrol is right
here with Corporal Canes while he is questioning the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>prisoner. He has him here for a purpose. Kline
will take the prisoner back to the support and having
been present at the examination, if he does give any
information Kline will know all about it and can tell
the support commander in case the man changes his
statements after recovering his composure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is one of the duties of a visiting patrol to pick
up persons found in the lines. It is of importance
that they be captured and every precaution towards
that end should be taken. Make it a rule that persons
wandering about in the outpost line have no
business to be there and take no chances on them getting
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Director distributes Situation No. 5 and
makes such explanation so as may be necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what would you
do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I am going back to the support
in a few minutes now, so I think I would take the
prisoner along with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, what do you think
about that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would not want to be bothered
with him. Besides we may run into some more enemy
scouts any time and this man would be in the
way and might make his escape. I would take no
chances. I would send him back to the support commander
at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “Why not send him over to outguard
No. 2 for the time being?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “That might be all right. But
if I were a support commander and one of my visiting
patrols picked up a prisoner, like we have, I
should want to see him as soon as practicable. I
think it would be much better to send him directly
back to the support. The support commander can
question him and make his plans for finding out
where the other scouts of the patrol to which he probably
belongs, are.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is the point that I wish to
bring out. In the first place, the Outguard Commander
will have no time to question the man. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>will have to busy himself immediately making
arrangements to send out patrols in his immediate
vicinity to see if he can find any other members of
the enemy’s forces. It is not likely that the man is
running around in our lines alone. There are others
with him. Corporal Canes would send the prisoner
back to the support commander immediately in order
that the Lieutenant may question him before he gets
over the confusion of being captured, and in order
that patrols may be sent out to find any of his comrades
that may also be within the lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, having decided to send the prisoner back,
Lieutenant Baker, how would you go about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “There are several things to be
considered in this procedure. The commander of
outguard No. 2 must be informed of what has happened
so that he may take the necessary action. The
support commander must be informed by a verbal
message of the circumstances attending the capture
of the prisoner. He must also be informed of the
immediate future action of the visiting patrol. I
would cover all of this in orders and a verbal message.
Private Kline has been with me when I was
questioning the prisoner. He knows the circumstances
attending the capture. I would send him
back with the prisoner and a verbal message to the
support commander. I would say to the prisoner:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Step over here and face in that direction. I am going
to send you back to our support commander by this
soldier (indicating Kline). I want to warn you that any
attempt to escape will be disastrous for you.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“I will say to Private Kline:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You conduct this prisoner back to the support commander
as quickly as possible. Have him march in front
of you. Place the point of your bayonet close to his
back. Do not let him escape. As you pass outguard No.
2 notify Corporal W of the circumstances and tell him
that we have gone on over to outguard No. 3. Tell the
support commander where we captured the prisoner;
that I could get nothing out of him except that he is lost;
that you have notified Corporal W at outguard No. 2.
That I am going to outguard No. 3 and will reconnoiter
in that vicinity and over as far as outguard No. 1 of
Support No. 3. You will remain at the support to be
available as a guide in case the Lieutenant needs you.
Do you understand all that you are to do?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“On receiving an affirmative reply I would direct
Kline and the prisoner ‘Move out.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I should say that you have covered
the situation most completely. It is most gratifying
to see you officers go about the solution to these
problems in this manner. It shows that you appreciate
the necessity for going into the details of
them.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Having disposed of the prisoner,
Corporal Canes with the remaining men of the visiting
patrol will go to outguard No. 3 and make the approach
to it in the same manner as heretofore indicated.
The prisoner’s rifle will be hidden in the
brush. It can be secured in the morning. Corporal
Canes would not want to be bothered with it at this
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You have arrived at outguard No. 3. The outguard
has just been alarmed by the sentinel. The
outguard commander suggests that you, Corporal
Canes, accompany him to the sentinel post. You
agree. The Corporal and yourself and the two members
of your visiting patrol proceed towards the sentinel.
As you approach the sentinel identifies you
and calls “Silence.” He tells you that he has heard
a suspicious noise in front of his post and points in
the direction from whence it came.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, what would you do
under the circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “It is the business of the visiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>patrol to investigate suspicious incidents that may
be reported by the sentinels. So I would go out and
investigate this one. I would take the two men of
my patrol with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We will assume that you are senior
to the outguard commander. Would you give him
any instructions?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I think I would have him send out
a small patrol to the interval between outguard No.
3 and No. 2.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “That is a point I had been
thinking about and I had just decided that I would
not do that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “On what line of reasoning did you
base the decision?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “Well, sir, if I were Corporal
Canes and going out with my visiting patrol I would
not want any other patrol out working around in my
immediate vicinity. There would be too much danger
of an accident. I would have to put in about half
of my time watching out for the other patrol to keep
from shooting them or to keep them from shooting
me. I am sure if I knew another patrol from the
outguard were out here I could not devote my undivided
attention to my reconnaissance of the enemy.
I would have Corporal R bring two of his men up to
the sentinel post and remain there until I get back
or if anything happens to me to come to my assistance.
I would have the remaining men of the outguard
remain on the alert at their post.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right in all you
have said and I feel sure that Captain Hall will agree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>with you on reconsideration. Is that not so, Captain
Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We then decide that Corporal
Canes is to make the reconnaissance with the two remaining
men of his visiting patrol; that he is going
to have Corporal R bring up two men of the outguard
to the vicinity of the sentinel post and that the remainder
of the outguard is to remain at the alert at
its post. Now, Lieutenant Hunt, just how will you
put this decision into the form of orders?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would issue my orders as
follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You have all the information of the enemy and our
own troops.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The visiting patrol will conduct a reconnaissance in
that direction (indicating).</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley and Harrison will follow me at the usual
distance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Corporal R, have two men of your outguard come
up here. If anything happens to my patrol come to our
assistance. Have the remainder of your men remain at
the outguard on the alert.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“When all is ready I will say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Manley and Harrison, follow me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will proceed in Indian file towards the suspicious
noise reported by the sentinel.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 7</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You have arrived at this point. You discover a
cavalryman’s horse, fully equipped, tied to that tree.
You reconnoiter the vicinity but can find no other
signs of the enemy.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, how do you
size up the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I have come to the conclusion
that the enemy prisoner told the truth when he
said he was lost. I do not believe there are any other
men of the enemy in this immediate vicinity. Had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>there been other men with the prisoner he surely
would not have dismounted and tied his horse to a
tree. If there were more in the party one man would
have been left out here to hold the horse while the
prisoner went forward to reconnoiter on foot. I
arrive at the conclusion that this is his horse and that
he is a member of the enemy patrol that was operating
over on the right of our line. He got lost and
was trying to find some of the men of his own patrol
when he ran into us. I do not think he realized that
he was inside of our lines at the time he was captured.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Has any member of the class a different
version of the affair than what Lieutenant
Williams has just explained?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I do not think we would be
justified in assuming that there are no more of the
enemy in this vicinity. Two enemy scouts have been
captured that we know of. These two men were not
scouting around here alone. There must be more of
them somewhere. It may be that others have come
in contact with our outguards that we have not heard
about.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Have you heard any firing tonight
along our lines?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Don’t you think that if there had
been very much enemy activity along our lines that
there would have been firing somewhere? I think it
is fair to assume that. I believe we would be pretty
well justified in assuming that the enemy activity is
limited to perhaps a patrol from which our prisoner
became lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The question now before us is what are we going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>to do? Lieutenant Wallace, what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would get this horse back
as quickly as possible and then I would extend my
reconnaissance farther to the front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Where would you send the horse?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “I would send him back to the
support commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Where would you send him, Lieutenant
Ralston?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I am not so sure I would
send him anywhere for the present. If we are to
continue our reconnaissance to the front I do not
figure that I would spare a man to send the horse
back. In any event I would send him no farther
than outguard No. 3. And I am not so sure that I
would go any farther on the reconnaissance. I do
not think a visiting patrol—so few men—should go
very far in front of the line of observation at night.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, what do you
think about all of this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I agree with Lieutenant Ralston.
Another point that presents itself to me is
this: When the support commander gets the prisoner
we sent back he will probably send our section
leader out with a patrol to reconnoiter the front and
the sergeant will want to see me and get what information
I have. The natural place for him to come
first to find me will be outguard No. 3. I think I
should get back there at least by the time the patrol
from the support reaches there. I estimate that I
could stay around here for a few minutes yet, but I
would have to be getting back pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would be your decision based
on your sizing up of the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “To send the horse back to outguard
No. 3 right away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Manley and myself would stay out here in concealment
for, say five minutes longer, and then go
back to the outguard by way of the sentinel post.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Any member of the class that does
not agree with that decision? (After waiting a moment.)
There seems to be none, so we will agree to
that solution of the problem.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 8</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You have arrived at outguard No. 3. On your
way back the outguard commander who was at the
sentinel post joined you. He left the two additional
men at the sentinel post. You explained to him what
happened on your reconnaissance to the front.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment Sergeant Hamilton, the section
leader in command of a patrol of one squad from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>support, arrives, and states that he has been ordered
to make a reconnaissance to the front of our line of
observation. Patrols are going out from the other
supports to reconnoiter their fronts. Sergeant
Hamilton says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Corporal Canes, give me all the information you
have.”</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>State the information you, Corporal Canes, would
give to Sergeant Hamilton.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I assume that each of you
have followed the details of the problem. You know
just what has taken place. Now, I want each of you
to write out on your pads just what you would say
to Sergeant Hamilton in reply to his instructions,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Give me all the information you have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to write down the exact words that
you would use if you were Corporal Canes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When all the members of the class have completed
their solutions they will be collected and again distributed,
making sure that no man receives his own
solution back again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director calls upon one or more members of
the class to read the solution in his possession and it
is discussed.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the conclusion of this the Director will submit
the following solution for discussion (copies of this
will be distributed to the class):</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'>“When my patrol arrived about midway between
outguard No. 2 and outguard No. 3 we captured a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>soldier of the enemy. I asked several questions. He
refused to answer, except that he said he was lost.
I sent him back to the support and came on over to
outguard No. 3. On arriving there the sentinel told
me that he had heard a suspicious noise out in front
of his post. I took two men and went out about 100
yards where I found a cavalry horse, fully equipped.
Sent him back to the outguard here. Made examination
to see if I could find any evidence of other horses
or men. Found none. Stayed a few minutes out
there. Heard nothing.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director reads the solution aloud. The members
of the class follow from the copy in their possession.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “This is merely one solution of the
problem. There may be others equally good. This
situation was devised to give you practice in imparting
information that you may have. On occasions
like this time may be limited and the information
will have to be given hurriedly and without waste of
words. The idea is that you should state the circumstances
of the incidents in the fewest words possible
and at the same time make clear just what has
happened. You will find practice of this kind very
valuable and will pay you large dividends on actual
service.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “This is the conclusion of our Terrain
Exercise on the subject of the visiting patrol.
I feel sure that if any one of you ever have occasion
to order out visiting patrols that you will have a better
idea of how they go about their tasks than you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>previously had. I am sure that you know what a
visiting patrol is and what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure you will appreciate how necessary it is
for your non-commissioned officers to be trained in
this work so they may know how to meet the situations
and solve the problems that may confront them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In outlining the future action of Corporal Canes’
patrol I may say that Sergeant Hamilton now assumes
responsibility for the further reconnaissance
to the front of the line of observation. Corporal
Canes will send Harrison back to the support commander
with the horse with a verbal message. Cline
has again joined him at outguard No. 3. The three
men, Corporal Canes, Manley and Cline continue the
operations of the visiting patrol, going on over to
outguard No. 1 of support No. 3 and then back to
their own support. On arrival there Corporal Canes
finds that it is about time for him to start out on the
rounds with his 2 o’clock patrol. This has been his
busy night.”</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c015'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>General Situation</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>A Blue battalion has bivouacked at (<i>a</i>). An outpost
with support along (<i>b</i>) has been established.
Support number (<i>c</i>) under the command of Lieutenant
A is at (<i>d</i>). It is now 2 o’clock p. m. The
posting of the outguards has been completed. The
support commander has made his inspection and sent
in his report to the outpost commander. The covering
troops have been withdrawn to the support.
There has been no contact with the enemy.</p>
<p class='c018'><b>Situation No. 1</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>At 2:05 o’clock p. m., a Mr. ——, who lives at
(<i>e</i>) comes to you, Lieutenant A, and gives you the
following information:</p>

<p class='c017'>I have just had a telephone conversation with a friend
of mine, who lives about (<i>f</i>) miles (<i>g</i>) of here. He states
that there is a Red force in the vicinity of (<i>h</i>). The telephone
went out before I could get any further information.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Lieutenant A, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation of Symbols</h4>

<p class='c012'>(<i>a</i>) State the location of the bivouac of the main
body of the battalion. This should be at a logical
point with reference to the location of the outpost
line.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>(<i>b</i>) State the location of the general line of outpost
supports.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) The number of the support commanded by
Lieutenant A. This should be given a logical number
with reference to the whole line of supports.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) The location of support (<i>c</i>). The point
where the Terrain Exercise is to start.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>e</i>) State where Mr. —— lives.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>f</i>) The number of miles from the support to
where Mr. ——’s  friend lives. This should
be several miles away.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>g</i>) The direction stated by points of compass
(North, South, East, West).</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>h</i>) The general location of the enemy. This
should be in the direction which it is intended to
send the reconnoitering patrol.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are assembled at (<i>d</i>),
where the outpost support is located.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director will distribute copies of the problem
to members of the class. A few minutes are allowed
them to read it. The Director then reads the problem
aloud and points out the places mentioned. One
or more of the members of the class are called upon
to state their understanding of the situation.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, I want each member of the
class to consider himself as being Lieutenant A, commanding
the outguard located at this point. Mr.
—— has just given you the information as
stated in the situation. What are you going to do
about it? Lieutenant Williams, just what would
you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would send out a patrol.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “How do you arrive at this decision
so quickly?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “Well, sir, I think that
would be the thing to do. I have gotten some important
information about the enemy. Details are lacking.
I would want to know more about how many
troops he has, what kind of troops they are and what
he is doing. I can see no better way to get this information
than by sending out a patrol to secure it
for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hastings, what do you
think about that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “There is always a question in
a case like this as to whether a pair of scouts should
be employed or whether a patrol is to be sent out.
I should size up the situation a few minutes. Examine
my map, if I had one, and then decide what measures
I would take. Another point that presents itself
to me is the question as to whether I should send
out the men from this support or whether it would
be better to send the information back to the outpost
commander and let him decide what is to be done.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Patrolling is usually conducted
from the supports. I think you would be justified
in taking the initiative in this case. At all events,
let us assume that you would.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “Can the Director give us some
information on the question of the employment of
scouts or patrols.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “There are no hard and fast rules
that may be invoked in arriving at such a decision,
but there are certain principles that may be applied,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>and when reconnaissance enterprises are to be undertaken
the condition should be examined closely. The
scout or pair of scouts would, as a rule, be preferred
when concealment is highly essential, and usually
when concealment, though not essential, is possible
throughout the reconnaissance, or when the enemy
habitually conducts his reconnaissance with strong
patrols and scouts have a better chance of eluding
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the following cases a patrol should be employed:
When information has to be sent in at intervals;
when it is desired to capture prisoners; when
concealment is deemed impossible; when the reconnaissance
is to be extended over such a period of time
that relief of scouts will be necessary; when an urgent
mission has been assigned and it is necessary to push
through the enemy’s covering troops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In some cases it may be advisable to employ a
patrol for the first part of the reconnaissance and at a
certain point break up into scouting parties of a single
scout or pair of scouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If possible, the individual preferences of the
most efficient scouts should be considered. Some men
lose self-confidence if attached to a patrol and are
limited in their actions by the direction of the patrol
leader; others dislike the responsibility of uncontrolled
action.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These are only general rules and cannot be followed
blindly. The circumstances of each occasion
must be taken into consideration in arriving at a
decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, considering the points I have stated, would
you employ scouts or a patrol in the case under consideration,
Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I think a small patrol would
be more suitable. There will probably be messages
to send back and the patrol may have to remain out
for a considerable length of time. I believe a patrol
would be more suitable than individual scouts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Let us then decide that we are to
send out a reconnoitering patrol to secure the information
we desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before going further with the problem, I want to
say a few words about the patrol.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The first duty of a patrol is to get
information, and information is greatly increased in
value if the enemy does not know that it has been obtained.
The patrol is required, primarily, to discover
whether or not the enemy is in a certain locality.
This information is only useful to the officer
who sent the patrol out. It is, therefore, the next
duty of the patrol to get the information back as
soon as possible, especially when the enemy is met.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Next of importance in the duties of the patrol is
to continue to observe the enemy when once discovered,
to follow him up and ascertain the direction
taken if he retires, or to fall back if he advances in
strength, endeavoring to keep even with him on a
flank. The enemy is certain to send out scouts to his
front, but may neglect his flanks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Boldness must be tempered with caution. It is
useless to obtain information if you cannot get it
back where it will do some good. A little information
sent in in time to be of use is clear gain to your
side. A patrol that finds out all about the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and ends up by falling into the hands of the enemy
is a dead loss not only in men but in time as other patrols
will have to be sent out to get the same information
on which important decisions may depend.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, one of the
first questions that will present itself to the support
commander is the selection of a patrol leader. What
factors would you consider in this matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Wallace</i>: “In the first place I would
want a non-commissioned officer for patrol leader;
further, I would want to send out the best qualified
one in the platoon. To meet this requirement I
would select the platoon sergeant to lead this patrol.
The importance of the mission is such as to warrant
sending him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, do you agree
with this solution?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “No, sir. I realize the importance
of the mission of the patrol. I know we should
have a qualified man to lead it, but I should hesitate
to send my platoon sergeant out.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are right and when
Lieutenant Wallace reflects on the matter I think he
will agree with you. The platoon sergeant has a multitude
of duties to perform in connection with the interior
administration of the platoon. In his administrative
capacity he is to the platoon what the first
sergeant is to the company. In addition, he has his
tactical duties to perform. He is the second in command,
and should anything happen to the platoon
leader he automatically assumes charge. There is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>other man in the platoon who is so familiar with all
the details of the dispositions of the support and the
orders under which it is operating. I do not believe
it would be good policy to send the platoon sergeant
out on a reconnoitering mission which may well extend
into the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, having rejected the idea of sending the platoon
sergeant, what man would you send in charge
of the patrol, Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I would send a section leader.
The one whose section is on the line of outguards.
He seems to me to be the most available man for the
duty.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I agree with you. Ordinarily in
an outpost support of this kind we take the outguards
from one of the sections of the platoon and
hold the other section to form the main body of the
support. This leaves the commander of the outguard
section surplus in a way, and makes him available
for important patrol duty, such as that we have
under consideration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next question that comes up is the strength
of the patrol. This is a reconnoitering patrol. Its
mission is to gain information of the enemy. It
need not be made strong to give it fighting power,
for it will not engage the enemy in combat except
as the last resort. It must not have any more men
than are absolutely necessary to carry out its mission,
for every additional man is a drag on the
patrol leader and subject the patrol to just that much
more danger of detection by the enemy. There will
be messages to be sent back, at least one and possibly
two or three. The patrol must be sufficiently strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>to provide these messengers without reducing it below
two men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Having all of these points in mind, what would
be the strength of the patrol, Captain Harvey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “I should say there would be at
least two messages to be sent back, and it may be
necessary to send one of them by two messengers. I
would not want the patrol leader to be left out alone.
These factors would indicate a strength of 5 men.
The patrol leader and 4 men.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Has any member of the class a different
idea than this?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “In my own mind I had tentatively
decided to send a complete squad. It seems to
me that we should send enough men so that if they
have to fight their way through to get the information
desired they could do it. Four men would not
be sufficient for the purpose. I should like some enlightenment
on this phase of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain James, can you answer
Captain Hodges?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain James</i>: “In the first place, a reconnoitering
patrol does not fight except as a last resort to
escape capture or to give warning of the approach of
the enemy and to delay him by firing on him. In the
next place, I do not see how this patrol will ever get
close enough to the enemy to get any really important
information if it starts to fight its way through
the Red covering troops. Once a shot is fired the
Red commander will send out sufficient patrols to
keep your patrol at a distance, and it will get no information
whatever. My idea is that any information
this patrol gets will be by avoiding the Red covering
troops and not by fighting.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span><i>The Director</i>: “I think you are correct. The
smaller the patrol, within limitations, the better. I
think a leader and four men is about right. Lieutenant
Baker, tell us what you would include in your
order to the patrol leader.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I would first tell the patrol
leader all the information I have about the enemy
and our troops. I would give him general direction
as to where I want the patrol to go. I would tell him
what information I want regarding the enemy. Tell
him in general terms where to return and where to
send messages.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “The final question that comes up is
that of the equipment of the men. How would you
have them equipped, Captain Hall?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would want them to go lightly
equipped. They should have a ration in their haversack;
not over 40 rounds of ammunition and their
rifle. I would have them leave the bayonets with
their packs. They will not need them.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “You see the process we have gone
through to determine that we are going to send out a
patrol of five men from the support. You see how
many things you have to consider in arriving at a
decision as to what you are going to do. This is what
we call making an ‘Estimate of the Situation.’ It
is merely a process of sizing up the situation and deciding
on what you are going to do to meet it. An officer
who fails to do this will in the end make a failure
of the soldier game. The one who does it habitually
has far greater chances for the operations he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>conducting to turn out a success. Just a few minutes’
systematic thought will save you a lot of military
blunders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Based on this estimate of the situation we arrive
at a decision to send out a patrol of five men to secure
information of the enemy. Lieutenant Barry, assume
that you are Lieutenant A, commanding the
support. Can you give us the orders necessary to
put the decision into operation?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I will try, sir. I will order:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Sergeant C (platoon Sergeant) turn out a reconnoitering
patrol of four privates, with Sergeant B (section
leader) as patrol leader. Have the men carry a ration
and 40 rounds of ammunition. Leave bayonets here.
Have Sergeant B report to me as soon as he is ready to
go out.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will frame up my orders to the patrol leader,
and as soon as he reports to me I will give them to
him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I have just received information that there is a Red

<p class='c010'>“I will send a runner to the other support commanders

to the outpost commander accompanied by a
runner and a message:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I am sending you a Mr. ——, who lives at
——. He informs me that he just had a telephone
conversation with a friend of his who lives ——

is in the vicinity of (<i>h</i>). The telephone went out before
he could get any further information. I am sending out
a reconnoitering patrol of four men under Sergeant B to
find out what they can. I will notify other supports of
the action I have taken.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will explain to Mr. —— that the information
he has given me is very important and tell
him that it will be necessary for him to go back to

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. Are there any
questions? Please do not hesitate to ask questions.
They are the very life of the Terrain Exercise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director endeavors to answer any question
that may be asked.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Each member of the class will now
consider himself to be Sergeant B. who has been designated
as the patrol leader. Lieutenant Hunt,
what equipment would you carry?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I would not want to be encumbered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>with a rifle, so I would not carry one. I would
want a pair of field glasses, a compass, a watch, a
wire cutter, pencils and a book of field message
blanks. If one were available I would want a map
of the country over which the patrol is to operate.
Each member of the patrol should be provided with
a compass and a wire cutter. At least one man should
carry a combination flag kit for wigwag and semaphore
signaling——”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I have understood that
visual signaling is about to be discarded in the service.
Can the Director give us some information on
that point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “There is a tendency to throw it
into the discard, but I am not so sure that it is right.
There are times when visual signaling has its place
and will save a lot of time and trouble. The codes
are easily learned and any intelligent man can master
the process within a comparatively short time.
I think there should be a few men in every rifle platoon
who are good signalers. Going back to the
equipment of the patrol, I think Lieutenant Hunt
has enumerated the essential items of equipment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Williams, suppose you were out on
patrol duty and captured one of the enemy scouts,
what is the first thing you would look for on him?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I would look for some
marking that would give me an identification—that
would give me information as to the outfit to which
he belongs.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is right. During the war
both sides took exceptional measures to secure identification
of units that were opposed to them. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>course, much of this work was done during the period
of so-called trench warfare, but the same idea holds
good in open warfare. Identification of the units to
which prisoners belong is always sought after by the
intelligence service. Now, Lieutenant Williams,
what does all of this point to with respect to our own
patrol?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “That the members of the
patrol should carry nothing with them that will serve
to give the enemy an identification, should one of
them be captured.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “You are right. Should one of our
soldiers be captured, the enemy should be able to
secure from him only his name and rank. The prisoner
should give no other information whatever.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before going out with a patrol the patrol leader
makes an inspection of his men. What is included
in this inspection, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “If I were making the inspection
I would satisfy myself that every man is physically
fit for the duty to be performed. I would not
want a man who has been on some strenuous duty
and is all worn out. I would see that every man is
properly armed and equipped, that each man has a
ration, 40 pounds of ammunition and a canteen full
of water. I would not allow a man to carry his roll.
I would see that the equipment is arranged so that it
will not rattle or glisten in the sunlight. I would
see that no man carried anything that would give the
enemy an identification or information that would
be of value to him. I will verify my own equipment
and make sure that I have everything that I will
probably require.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>The Director will now hand out the slips bearing

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Wallace, we will assume
that you are Sergeant B. You have made the

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. I think you
have covered all the points that should be included
in the patrol commander’s order. I wish each member
of the class would compare this order with the
kind that is usually mumbled out to members of a
patrol by the average patrol leader at maneuvers. It
is a fact that most patrols go out, either with orders
that they do not understand or with no orders at all.
Do not allow this to be done under any circumstances.
You can well afford to hold up the departure of the
patrol until the patrol commander can dope out his
orders and give them properly. And you must insist
on this being done. If you do not do so it will
never be done properly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I want each member of the class to write
our Sergeant B’s orders to his patrol. Try to get

<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you, Sergeant B, do.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “The commander of a patrol will
see the commander of the outguard at the place where
he crosses the line of observation and give him information
as to where he is going and what he is going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>for. In addition to this he secures any information
that the outguard commander may have of the country
to the front and the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This procedure is especially necessary in the present
case. Sergeant B’s mission will probably keep
him out late, so that it will be after dark when he
comes back through the lines. In order to avoid
chances of being mistaken for the enemy a recognition
signal should be arranged for at this time.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, you are Sergeant
B, the patrol leader. The outguard commander
has come out to meet you. Just what would you
do with respect to your patrol and what would you
say to the outguard commander?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “In the first place I will signal
the patrol to halt. I will then tell the outguard
commander where we are going and all about the
mission of the patrol. I will arrange a recognition
signal with him. I will find out any information
about the enemy that he may have.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. You have told us all
about what you will do. Now let us do it. Assume
that I am the outguard commander. Now just what
will you say to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I will say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Information has been received that there is a Red
force in the vicinity of (<i>h</i>). (Indicating on the map.)
We are going out as a reconnoitering patrol, guiding on
the&nbsp;... road. (Indicating on the map.) We are
to determine the enemy’s strength, and composition and
what he is doing. I have four other men with me.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>“‘We will probably be out until after dark and I want
to arrange a recognition signal with you. If agreeable
to you it will be the call 3—4 or the same tapped on the
rifle stock.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Have you any information about the enemy?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“After doing all of this I will signal the patrol
FORWARD MARCH and proceed on my way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is very good. I wish you
would explain to the class just how you propose to
employ the recognition signal.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “In this case we agreed on
the signal 3—4. When any of us approach the sentinel
post of the outguard after dark we will use the
recognition signal. If there is no danger of enemy
patrols lurking in the vicinity the man approaching
the post calls out 3—4; the sentinel on post answers
the call by calling 3—4 and they both know that
everything is all right and it is safe for the scout to
proceed. If there is danger of enemy patrols discovering
the signal should it be called out, the man
coming in would approach the sentinel post cautiously.
He would tap 3—4 on the stock of his rifle until
it is recognized by the sentinel and the signal returned
by the latter tapping 3—4 on the stock of his
rifle.” (The method should be illustrated.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, why do we go to
all this trouble?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “A sentinel on post, after he has
been harassed by enemy scouts for a while, takes no
chances. He generally shoots first and then challenges.
The recognition signal is simply an expedient
to lessen the chances of accident.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span><i>The Director</i>: “Now all of these details may seem
to be small affairs to you. But the man who knows
them and requires them to be carried out in service
is the man who will be successful in military operations.
Almost any dub can blunder through, paying
the price in the lives of his men. It is the man
that knows all of the little details of tactics that will
come through successfully with his command without
the sacrifice of a man more than is necessary to accomplish
his mission. The proposition of measuring
accomplishment by the number of casualties is old
stuff and will not go with the commander that is up

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted along the route of the
patrol for a distance of some 600 yards, where it is
halted.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “It is assumed that the patrol has
advanced a distance of some two miles from the outpost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>and has arrived at this vicinity. This assumption
is made in order to save time and energy. We
can get just as much training out of our Terrain Exercise
by coming this 600 yards as we could by walking
the entire two miles. The idea is that we get into
new terrain for each phase of the problem.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director now distributes the papers bearing
Situation No. 4 to the members of the class.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 4</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You, Sergeant B, the patrol leader, have arrived
at this point. There has been no contact with the
enemy.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What is the formation of your patrol at this
moment?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Before going into the details of
this situation, I desire to say a few words about the
conduct of the operations of a patrol. It is impossible
to lay down any hard and fast rule for the conduct
of a patrol. Each situation will have to be
worked out by itself. Each solution will vary with
the nature of the country over which you are operating
and what the enemy does. A few general principles
only may be enunciated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The patrol leader, as he advances toward his objective,
will mentally make note of various intermediate
objectives to serve as stepping stones for his
further advance. He can never be certain that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>will not encounter the enemy, and must be prepared
at all times for such an event.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the patrol advances in one body, a hostile patrol
will allow them to approach and then ambuscade
and capture them. Further, all the members of
the patrol would not be able to see much more than
one man. If the patrol advances in an extended line
of skirmishers, capture is rendered much more difficult,
but each man will be acting more or less independently,
and it will be most difficult for the patrol
leader to control the operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A patrol should assume the general formation of
a column on the march, <i>i. e.</i>, there is an advance
guard, a main body, flankers, and a rear guard.
These several elements may be represented by only
one man, but the principle is exactly the same. The
advance man is necessary to give warning of the approach
of the enemy. The flankers are necessary to
watch toward the flanks and prevent the enemy from
ambuscading the patrol or working around its rear
unobserved and cutting off its line of retreat. The
main body is necessary to back up the advance man
and protect him. The rear man is the “get-away
man,” so that in case the patrol is surprised by the
enemy, at least one man will have a good chance to
escape and carry the news back to the support commander.
You must always remember that a patrol
that goes out and does not return, or is not heard
from within a reasonable time, is the cause for a
great deal of uneasiness and anxiety back at the outpost
line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some authorities advocate that the patrol commander
march as the advance man of the patrol.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>This is not believed to be good tactics. He should be
centrally located so that he will be able to control the
operations of the patrol. The patrol leader has been
selected for this particular line of work. The officer
who sent him out is depending on him to carry out the
mission upon which he has been sent and to get information
back. He should not, therefore, needlessly
make himself a target for the enemy marksman
who may be lying in concealment at the turn of a
road or trail. If he is the leading man he will be so
busily occupied with the task of observation, that he
will have little time available for conducting the operations
of the other members of the patrol. Furthermore,
if anything happens at the front that needs
his attention, he can go there in a very short space of
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When a small patrol is advancing along a road
which is more or less winding and has brush and trees
along the side, it is believed that the Boni point formation
will usually meet the requirements. In this
formation the leading man walks along one side of
the road, close up to the brush. The next man follows
him at a distance of about 25 yards on the opposite
side of the road. The remaining men follow at
varying distances on alternate sides of the road. The
rear or get-away man should march at least 75 yards
in rear of his next preceding man. Flankers are
sent out when necessary and where it is possible to
do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will be surprised to see how admirably this
formation will meet the situation under the conditions
stated. The next time you are out on a winding
road through the woods, step over to one side and observe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>to the front. Then go to the other side and
repeat the operation. You will find that from one
side your view will be very much restricted, while
from the opposite side it will be much more extended.
One trial will convince you of the suitability of this
formation.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Now, having in mind what I have
just said, I want each member of the class to determine
for himself just where each member of the patrol
would be at the moment he, himself, arrived at
this point. (The Director indicates the point on the
ground where the patrol leader is.) Make a rough
sketch of this vicinity to show the solution.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The location selected for this situation should be
one where there is something that will test the tactical knowledge
of the student. To base it otherwise would be of little
value.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will allow a few minutes for the solution of
this part of the problem, during which time you
should look over the ground and decide upon the disposition
of your patrol, just where each man will be
at this particular moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the members of the class have completed
this solution they will be collected and discussed.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—The discussion will depend upon the solution. The
points included in the Director’s explanation should be brought
out and fully discussed.)</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The members of the class are now conducted along
the line of march of the patrol to a point where the
road may be observed for a distance of some several
hundred yards.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director distributes the papers containing the
following situation:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 5</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The patrol has arrived at this point. You, Sergeant
B, are here. The leading man halts, crouches
down, points down the road, and holds his rifle horizontally
above his head.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Sergeant B, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, just what
would you do under the circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would interpret the actions
of the leading man to indicate that he has observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the enemy and that they are in small numbers. I
would signal the patrol to halt and then signal
‘DOWN,’ which would indicate to the men that they
are to take cover. I would then join the leading man
to see for myself what is happening out in front.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think we may all agree that your
solution up to this point is correct. Now, let us assume
that the leading man is at —— (indicate exact
location) and you are here. I want you to show
the class exactly how you would join him.</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Lieutenant Ralston gives the practical demonstration
and the class moves up to where the leading man is supposed
to be.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there any member of the class that would do
it differently?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—If any member has any criticism of the solution,
have him go back to the starting point and demonstrate how he
would do it.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Harvey, let us assume
that you are Sergeant B. You have joined your
leading man here and he points out to you what he
has seen. You observe six enemy infantrymen
marching down the road in a formation similar to the
one your patrol is now in. The leading man is at
——. (The Director points out the exact location
of the enemy’s leading man, which should be at least
500 yards distant.) Apparently they have not observed
you. What is your reaction to this situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “At this moment I would have
no means of telling whether these men are an enemy
patrol or the point of an advance guard. The formation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>would be about the same. Can the Director
give us definite information on that point?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Let us assume for the
moment that it is an enemy patrol. What would
you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “Under those circumstances, I
would have my patrol take cover and let the enemy
patrol go on by.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That would be the logical thing to
do. Now, let us assume that the enemy are the point
of an advance guard. What would you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “In that event I would open fire
on them immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “What would be your object in doing
that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Harvey</i>: “By opening fire I give warning
to our outpost that the enemy is advancing and I delay
him because he will have to stop and make more
or less reconnaissance before proceeding.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hodges, do you agree with
that solution?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “No, sir. This is a reconnoitering
patrol. Its mission is to get information of the
enemy’s strength and composition. If we fire on
the point of this advance guard, all hope of getting
any information of what is behind it is gone. It
will not take the advance party commander very
long to discover that we are only a patrol and he will
simply run over us. Sufficient patrols will be sent
out to the flanks to keep us away and we will get no
information of any value to our own commander. I
most certainly would not fire on the enemy at this
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span><i>The Director</i>: “What action would you take?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hodges</i>: “I would wait a few minutes to
try and determine the strength of the enemy’s advance
party. This would give me a general line on
his strength. I would then send my leading man,
who has seen the enemy himself, back to the support
commander as fast as he could go with the information
we have. This would be a verbal message. I
would have no chance to write it out. I would then
conduct the rest of my patrol off to the —— flank
under cover with a view to working around abreast
of the enemy’s main body to secure information of
his strength and composition. I would keep in contact
with him to try and discover the direction of his
deployment and what his intentions are. I would
make strenuous efforts to get all of this information
back to my support commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Those are the points I wanted to
bring out. I do not think our patrol would be justified
in opening fire on the enemy under the circumstances.
We will assume that the enemy troops are
a patrol, and that we have decided to avoid them and
let them go on by. Just how would you go about
that task, Captain James?”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Captain James’ solution will depend upon the Terrain
and the cover available.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director will point out to the class and dwell
upon the principle that, having decided to avoid the
enemy’s patrol, the all-absorbing duty of the patrol
leader is to conceal his patrol so that the enemy will
have no information that it is anywhere in the vicinity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>The measures to accomplish this will then be
worked out in the minutest detail. It may be well to
have members of the class take post to represent the
members of the patrol and have other members of
the class to go out and represent the enemy’s patrol
and advance just as they would under service conditions.
Then have Captain James solve the problem
of getting his patrol under cover without being discovered
by the enemy.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Explanation</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “We must give the enemy’s patrol
credit for being on the alert and for having such a
knowledge of tactics that he will do the reasonably
proper thing. If he sees one member of our patrol,
the difficulty of avoiding him will be doubly increased.
Our task, then, is to get to cover as quickly
as possible. It is this seeming trivial action that
sometimes calls for all the ingenuity that the patrol
leader may possess. The road may be open for a considerable
distance, so that if one of the members of
our patrol crosses from one side to the other he will
be seen and the position disclosed to the enemy. It
may be necessary for the patrol to fall back a short
distance in order to secure the necessary cover. It
may be necessary, in order to avoid discovery, to
direct all men on one side of the road to take cover
on their side and the remainder to seek cover on
the opposite side. This means a dispersion of the
patrol and the consequent danger of getting lost and
also the difficulties of assembling again. This points
to the advisability of training the men to all take
cover on the same side of the road when the enemy is
encountered as in this case.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When members of the class are in place to represent
the enemy and our own patrol, the Director will
give a signal and the movement starts. The enemy
patrol moves along as it would naturally and Captain
James proceeds to get the members of his patrol
under cover. His method should be discussed by the
class and the defects of it pointed out. It may be
necessary to enact the solution several times before
a satisfactory one is found.</p>

<p class='c010'>The demonstration completed and the class again
assembled, the Director proceeds with the problem.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Baker, would you send
back any message to the support commander about
the enemy patrol?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I think that is a point that the
patrol commander should consider. I am not clear
in my own mind just what should be done under the
circumstances. I would be pleased to have the
Director enlighten us on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “We assume that this is a small enemy
reconnoitering patrol. It would have the same
mission as our own patrol. The point to be considered
is whether or not anything in the message
you send back would materially assist in the defense
of the outpost line, or whether it could contain any
information of special value to the outpost commander.
Our covering patrols sent out from the supports
will keep the enemy away from the outpost
line. They will soon discover that it is only a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>patrol and will drive it off. We have only a few men
with the patrol. If one is sent back with a message
at this time it may leave the patrol leader shorthanded
when there is something really important
that must be sent back. The mission of the patrol is
to secure information of the enemy’s main body.
That is the information that is of importance to the
support and outpost commander. I do not believe
the patrol commander would be justified in sending
back a message at this time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Baker</i>: “I see the point.”</p>

<p class='c017'>(Note.—Should any members of the class insist that a message
should be sent back, he may be called upon to compose the
message, and it should be examined to see whether it contains
information that is vital to the defense of the outpost.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted to a point where they
have a view of an open field some 1,200 yards distant.
It may be assumed that the patrol has marched several
miles in order to arrive at this place.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director now distributes the sheets containing
Situation No. 6.</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span><b>Situation No. 6</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>The patrol successfully evaded the enemy’s patrol,
continued the march, and without encountering any
other enemy troops has arrived at this point. The
enemy patrol proceeded on down the road toward the
outpost line.</p>

<p class='c010'>On arriving here you observe a force of the enemy
marching into that field. They are apparently going
into bivouac. You estimate the enemy to be one
regiment of Infantry.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The Director should point out the location of the
enemy and should indicate the exact location of each
member of the patrol, so that all members of the
class will make their solutions on the same basis.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Captain Hall, what would you do
under the circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I would send a message to the support
commander telling him what I have seen.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Is there anything that you would
do before starting to compose your message?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hall</i>: “I do not think so. I have located
the enemy and want to get the information back as
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is true. But there are certain
things that must be done in connection with it.
You have discovered what you estimate to be the enemy’s
main body. You know the strength and composition
of it. You know what he is doing for the
time being. The members of your patrol are still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>in patrol formation and must be told what to do. In
other words, there are several things to be done. In
the first place, you want to dispose your men for observation
of the enemy and to prevent surprise. Enemy
patrols may be operating in the vicinity. One
of these may pick you up and prevent you from getting
any information back. This is the thing you
must guard against. You must consider the contents
of your message and you must figure out how
you are going to get it back considering the fact that
there is an enemy patrol of six men operating between
you and the outpost line.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the patrol has encountered the enemy the
disposition must be such as to permit the leader to observe
the hostile force for the purpose of forming an
estimate of its strength and composition, dispositions,
and probable intentions. With this end in
view, the leader must go to a vantage point from
which he may obtain a good view of the enemy. The
remaining members of the patrol must be so disposed
as to guard all the avenues of approach from the
known direction of the enemy’s forces, in order to
prevent surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lieutenant Barry, what disposition would you
make of the members of the patrol?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Lieutenant Barry</i>: “I would select a good observation
point where I can see the enemy and what he is
doing. I would select two of the men to carry the
message back. I would post a man to watch for enemy
patrols and post a get-away man somewhat to
my rear.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span><i>The Director</i>: “All right. Select your observation
post and give the orders necessary to carry out
what you have just said.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The solution will depend upon the lay of the
ground. The points to be brought out are that patrol
leaders must be able to observe the enemy in security
and not have to bother about being surprised
by enemy patrols. The lookouts will be posted so
that they can watch the approaches. The men that
are to carry the message should be with Sergeant B
while he is composing it so that they will be able to
tell the support commander all about the situation
when they get back with the message. The get-away
man will be posted in such position as will make
sure that he will not be included in any disaster to
the patrol.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The dispositions having been completed, the next
question is that of the contents of the message.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I want each member of the class to
write out the body of the message that he would send
back to the support commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the message has been completed and turned
in by all the class they are distributed and various
members called upon to read and comment on the
one in his possession. The points that should be included
in the message are:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Information of the strength and composition
of the enemy main body. What he is doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Information of the strength and composition
of the enemy patrol that was passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The future action of the patrol in so far as it
can be determined.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Director should then compose a message covering
the above requirements and submit it to the class
for discussion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Have observed a force of the enemy, estimated one

They are now going into bivouac. A hostile patrol of

at —— (time)  which proceeded in the direction of
the outpost line. I will remain in observation until forced
to retire or darkness prevents further reconnaissance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Hunt, how would you
get the message back to the support commander?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Hunt</i>: “I have had Anderson and
Bailey here with me while making my observations
and composing the message. I will send it back by
them, each man taking a different route. I will read
the message to them. I will indicate on the map the
general route that each man is to take in going back
to the support and caution each of them to look out
for the enemy patrol that is between us and the outpost
line. By sending the message by two men going
over different routes I am almost sure to get it
through. If one of them runs into the enemy, it is
pretty safe to say that the other will not.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think your sizing up of the situation
is very good. You have taken all the precautions
possible for getting the message back safely
to the support commander.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Director now distributes the sheets containing
Situation No. 7 to the members of the class. A few
minutes are allowed to read it over, and it is explained.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 7</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>You are still observing the enemy. Nothing has
happened to cause you to change your estimate of
his strength and composition. His outposts are being
established and they are pushing out patrols to
the front and flanks. Your position is becoming untenable.
You have heard distant firing in the direction
of the Blue troops.</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What action do you, Sergeant B, take?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Williams, what would
you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Williams</i>: “I estimate that it is about
time for me to be getting out with what is left of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>patrol. I have accomplished my mission in so far as
the main body of the enemy is concerned. His bivouac
for the night has been located. He has established
his outposts, which indicates that he will probably
not make any more moves today. The operations
of the hostile patrols will soon make my position
untenable. There is little to be gained by my
staying here any longer and taking a chance on being
picked up. I would get on my way back to my
own troops.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Has any member of the class any
criticism of that solution?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “It seems to me that Sergeant
B would now have another mission imposed upon
him by the conditions. It is that of intercepting enemy
scouts from getting back with information from
the patrol that passed us. How about that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That is true. It is the point that
I was going to bring up next. The fact that you
have heard firing from the direction of our own
troops indicates that contact has been gained and the
enemy patrol has gotten some information of our
forces. This he will endeavor to get back to his own
commander. In view of the fact that the patrol
leader does not know that our patrol is between him
and his own troops he may not think it necessary to
take the precautions to send it by two messengers,
and I think it is reasonable to assume that he will
direct his messenger along the main road where he
can make the better time than he can in going across
country. You now have two men with you, Carlin
and Davis. How would you manage the withdrawal
and what would be your formation on the way back?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>What route would you take? How would you solve
all of these points, Captain Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Captain Hastings</i>: “I would signal Carlin, who is
observer, to join me. This accomplished, I would
signal Davis to move out toward the main road. I
would make my withdrawal as rapidly as possible
and when we get away some little distance I would
signal Davis to slow down until we caught up with
him. I would get on or near the main road and
march with Davis as the leading man, following him
at a distance of about 25 yards and have Carlin follow
me at the same distance. I would keep a sharp
lookout for enemy scouts with a view to intercepting
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “I think your solution meets the
situation very well. Are there any questions?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Procedure</h4>

<p class='c012'>The class is now conducted back along the main
road to a point selected for Situation No. 8.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Problem</h3>
<p class='c016'><b>Situation No. 8</b>:</p>

<p class='c010'>When you arrive at this point you observe an enemy
scout coming down the road in your direction at
a walk. You can see some distance beyond him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>he appears to be alone. (The Director will point out
the location of the enemy scout.)</p>
<p class='c018'><i>Required</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>What do you do?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Solution</h4>

<p class='c012'><i>The Director</i>: “Lieutenant Ralston, how do you
size up the situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I estimate that the man is
carrying a message from his patrol leader to the commander
of the Red forces. My mission is to capture
him and prevent the message going back. If practicable
the capture must be effected without resorting
to firing. If we have to fire it will give warning to
the enemy’s patrol operating toward our outpost
and the patrol commander would assume that his
messenger is in trouble and would send another message
by another route. Furthermore, firing at this
time would give the alarm to the patrols operating
from the hostile outpost, and they would rush to the
rescue of their comrades.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “Tell us just how you would go about
the capture of the messenger?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would form an ambuscade
here with Davis and myself on one side of the road
and Carlin on the other side about 25 yards in rear
of us. When the messenger arrives at about 10 yards
from us, Davis and myself will jump out into the
road and order him to surrender. We will endeavor
to surprise him and take him without firing a shot.
If by any chance he should get by us, Carlin would
be in position to intercept him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span><i>The Director</i>: “Just what would you say when you
order him to surrender?”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lieutenant Ralston</i>: “I would jump out on the side
of the road, level my rifle at him and yell at him as
loud as I could, ‘Drop your rifle—throw up your
hands.’ If he did as ordered I would explain to him
that he is now a prisoner of war and that resistance
is useless. If he did not do as I told him on the instant
or if he made any attempt to escape or move to
fire on me I would open fire on him at once. I would
take no chances with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>The Director</i>: “That seems to be a reasonable solution.
This is a very simple proposition and presents
little difficulty. It is brought before you at this time
merely to show you the procedure that makes for
reasonable chances for success. The capture of several
scouts or a patrol is a much more difficult undertaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a general rule in the attempt to capture
members of a patrol that the situation we desire to
produce when we meet them is that they should be
marching and that we should be halted. By adopting
this method, we form an ambuscade.”</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The details of the advance against the enemy’s position should
be discussed by the class and worked out on the ground. It is impossible

to the ground, the Director should decide upon the location of the
line of observation and the line of resistance and bring out the points
indicated above. He should decide upon the location of the outguards
and their strength.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The Director should take advantage of every opportunity to get
members of the class to ask questions. It is by this means that we are
able to bring out the tactical points of the problems and make them
clear. If no questions are asked, it is natural to assume that the
members of the class understand everything that is under discussion,
whereas many of them may not understand at all. The more questions
a Director can get out of a class the more effective will the
training be.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is the form of order that comes to us day after
day. Sometimes in a letter, sometimes by wire, often accompanied
by a request for special delivery service. Many
times a passage is added:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The point we make is this. The mere possession of a
copy of Reserve Officers’ Examiner will not prepare you
for examination for promotion or keep you in touch with
the subjects it covers. You must know its contents. These
may not be absorbed by the average man by a casual
glance through the book. Its contents must be studied
the same as you study anything else you want to learn.</p>

<p class='c010'>You should not put off getting your copy of Reserve
Officers’ Examiner until the last minute—when you are
face to face with your examination. Get your copy now.
Devote a little time to the study of its contents. Then
when the opportunity comes for promotion—as it surely
will—you will be prepared for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Explaining is half the work of instructing. Talk saves
work—when it is the right kind of talk. For the instructor,
explaining—talking is the hardest part because it means constant
brushing up, reading, study, thought and planning—all
of which takes time, and time counts heavily in the game
of intensive training.</p>

<p class='c010'>THIRTY-MINUTE TALKS are offered as time-savers for
the instructor. They are in no sense treatises of the subjects
considered—just plain, everyday talks, in language the man
new to the service will be able to understand. They will save
the instructor’s time by furnishing him with a guide which
he may rearrange or elaborate as he chooses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject matter of the Thirty-Minute Talks are as follows:</p>
